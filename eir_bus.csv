"Public service suitable Ireland's second city. Let preface saying judgement limited Cork city, relative several episodes experienced first-hand. I also stress I fair amount experience using public transport nations. The public transport service seems standard considered Ireland's second city, because:- journeys; increase frequency journeys. Just give examples seen first weeks stay Cork (but knows else is), lines (e.g. 245) regularly queue get Cork station! I waited standing several times quarter hour half hour.... There lines (such 210) run every 90 minutes ( I talking city centre). Furthermore, already happened full stop!- many delays: point indicating timetable many delays one longer looks tables relies fate;- electronic realtime signs city centre, exceptions (perhaps mainly urban decorations);- indications stops non-existent, incomprehensible useless. I would like able orient lines looking boards posted shelters, without Google Maps another navigator (as, example, possible London);- public service considered going work important appointments: I cancel appointments this. I strongly advise relying it, take well advance always ready call taxi gets bad. It suitable elderly people, students, reasons car, thats all;- slow service stops (time wasting boring): fact, first one door get off, wait every time getting last person gotten off! Waiting passengers get may justifiable metro, ! Once board, every time get , turn driver tell want go, least put card front him. Basically driver also acts ticket taker.- rules luggage, depends mood driver maybe knows ( I quite figured yet). If want carry heavy luggage, hope driver wants open lower compartment door, otherwise carry heavy suitcases cabin ( I'm talking lines buses lower luggage racks).- traveling Cork, despite general low quality service offered, expensive; On POSITIVE side:- buses I've seen far clean modern;- drivers general courteous professional, although normal occasionally find rude ones (as almost everywhere);- customer service works, answered several times, I think certain point. I would like clear I criticizing management: I capable carrying analyses. I limit indicating facts experienced firsthand objective way possible without reasons see improve one day, possible.

Both buses seldom less 10 minutes late ( I've never actually either one buses show time). Often 103 Dublin show left waiting upwards half hour two buses row drive I cannot fathom since neither buses even close full time. Getting 103 town Ashbourne I've left waiting two hours occasions drivers driving town clue next is, granted they're covering journey obviously fair hold anyways responsible would appreciated they're bit communications drivers drivers HQ passengers could told next is. The 109a even shocking I used rely get college would often show leaving waiting another hour next show up. The 109a meant airport I'm actually surprised lack service reliability given customers.

I daughter me, next 2 hours time, I pay food & drinks I would needed time, I emailed I wanted refund, I felt least Eirreann could huge inconvenience. They emailed back, basically things bound go wrong time time, control, refused refund. If happen sitting window raining, chances get leaked packed can't move seats, buses old, serious need updating. No much legroom, often dirty, sometimes rude driver,and ny broken twice month!! But even worse that, ""customer Care"", I use term loosely, never, ever want know, I've complained, I always get basic standard reply.....very obvious care, all! There much better buses maybe 2 , opinion, I'd rather pay extra! The I switched light, airy, clean, leg room,sockets phones, DO NOT LEAK!! Plus express gets way ahead Eirreann. My daughter I used catch 4 times week, they've lost out.... But clearly, keeping customers happy top agenda, never been, never be, long pack passengers like sardines, that's care about!! I absolutely would recommend Eirreann!!",2019-07-17
