"This bus service is one of the worst…This bus service is one of the worst service. Always coming late if it is 5 10 min late then it can b accepted but it’s always more than 20 min. This is my 3rd time experienc. Not comfortable seat, no Wi-Fi, even there is no USB port. Always go for flixbus or national express.",06 January 2024
"Victoria - Manchester - VictoriaPros:- clean toilet with water- okay seats- priceCons:- driver didn’t announce anything. Not leaving Victoria (no welcome, not even destination) and nothing on the first stop either (how long, where we were etc)- USB chargers did not work- no seat pockets to store water/snacksBus appeared worn/old. Maybe a replacement because of mechanical problems with an other bus?",26 December 2023
"Disappointed on this occasionI use Megabus to travel on a regular basis and have never had any issues. Sadly on this occasion I was disappointed. The bus turned up 25 mins late with no explanation given, this then had a knock on effect on the rest of the journey. Because of this delay, I missed 2 ongoing trains to my destination. While I do appreciate road travel has its drawbacks, the lack of communication by the driver was very unhelpful.",27 December 2023
It's alright but doesn't let u know…It's alright but doesn't let u know when there's gonna be seriously late delays so u don't know if your bus is still gonna come some have usb ports that work some don't its cheap so that's the good thing about it and I use these at least twice a week the time went past 12 o'clock and had it on for tommrow so had to pay 3.75 to change the date think that's an absolute joke,04 January 2024
"Megabus does what it says on the tin…Megabus does what it says on the tin with the time table. Ease of change over in Birmingham. Helpful driver, if there is a problem with delays due to traffic, or anything behond megabues control, the driver keeps you informed. Only one thing that drives me nuts. Is inconsiderate fellow passengers spending a long, long, long, time talking very loudly on their phones.",22 December 2023
"Very very small space compounded by a recliner Overnight journeyOvernight journey, passenger Infront has fully reclined their seat, the back of their seat is now only 15cm from my nose, can't use my tray, can't even cross my legs because of lack of room, I am only 5 foot 4inches tall.",06 January 2024
"Return trip @ London Victoria to…Return trip @ London Victoria to Sinderland. Drivers very warm, friendly and the stops helped to stretch our legs.However trip from Sunderland to London Victoria on the 28th December kinda stressful. Drivers didn't stop for passengers break only stopped to pick passengers. This should be improved.",30 December 2023
"I used to prefer megabus everytimeI used to prefer megabus everytime, because they charge reasonable prices on tkt on a trip compare to other bus services. So everyone can afford it. I hope it will be the same for long time.",04 January 2024
"Very efficient serviceVery efficient service, helpful and friendly driver got me home within good time just before schedule.I would definitely recommend although be aware that the toilet on board is tiny, if your more then a size 14 or taller than 5.6ft you might struggle getting in and out of the cubicle.",30 December 2023
Ignorant driverChange over driver was very unpleasant needs to go on a customer service course. Almost decapitation my friend & myself as we were retrieving our luggage he'd got bk on the bus & boot closed !!!,22 December 2023
"It took a while for me to find the…It took a while for me to find the coach terminus at Heathrow (terminal 3). Probably would be handy to have details on that from Megabus, such as a description or map. But once I got there the coach was on time and driver was professional. There is no covered stand in Bristol, so getting off the bus in the pouring rain would be a challenge. Luckily it was dry that morning. Overall an easy service to use.",30 December 2023
"The journey both ways was excellentThe journey both ways was excellent, the drivers were so helpful and polite!The lady driver was a good strong leader too, being aware of the time moving on, she requested; quite rightly for everyone to take their seats!Fab service, I cannot praise your drivers enough!",23 December 2023
"Late Arrival due to Heavy Traffic/Driver regulationsThe bus from Sunderland was on time, maybe fifteen minutes late, but on return from Newcastle under lyme the bus was just over an hour late and the bus shelter was not good at preventing us from getting soaked in the pouring rain.  Due to heavy traffic we were delayed another half hour into Manchester.  I accept that Megabus cannot be blamed for traffic problems.  But when we got to Huddersfield, due to regulations, the driver couldn’t leave for another half hour, which meant we were going to be two hours late in arriving in Sunderland.  We had to rearrange our taxi pick up.The good news is that both ways we travelled in a ‘proper’ Megabus, so we could sit in our booked seats!  The drivers were very good and polite.",27 December 2023
"Christmas TravelI travelled on the 24th December, with anxiety and worry on how and what my experience might be.I was pleasantly surprised. It was a smooth journey. Driver and all Megabus staff were professiomal and treated all passengers with courtesy, respect and smile. Very hel[ful with bags, wheel chair, and buggies. Thank you",24 December 2023
The journey was comfortable and the…The journey was comfortable and the drive was safe. However the only thing I felt uncomfortable was the cold AC at first as the weather was freezing. Also the lights at some point which aren’t necessary on my opinion to be on in the daytime.,02 January 2024
"No refund in the case of missing bus or having to cancel travelI dislike the fact that once a person misses his or her time to get to the bus station, the bus would leave and nothing will be done to refund your paid bus fare. I have lose up to £90 or more because of missing bus or having to change time of travel due to some reasons.But sometimes your buses do get to the station late and no apology for that.The toilet in your buses are always dirty and smelling because nobody cleans it up till the end of the journey.",24 December 2023
"Coach Nothing seems to matter .Coach was fine ,nice and clean. A nice warm cosy Coach, except  I  booked an paid for a reserved seat which was non existent. So I  paid for a service I  never received.  It was same on return  journey  I was told to sit anyplace.As I am disabled, I can't stand in ques  so can't get a descent seat I  require  hence I reserved seats which you totally  disregard.  Obviously, when you  use city link coaches ,it's a slight problem as seating rows are different.However your information sheets to your drivers should  acknowledge that fact seats have been reserved.  So I  paid out money and got nothing for itMegabucks reply was but while  that's OK for them I  have to wait in a queue now outside in the rain just to make sure I  get on the busMy back is such that it means I  have then got to travel in pain cos of needles standing.",02 January 2024
"Driver lacks empathy- Birmingham-NottinghamI had to re-book the return leg of my journey at the bus stop due to a mistake with the original booking. I was having difficulty buying the new ticket with my phone so needed to use my laptop instead. I asked the driver who was swapping over to the new driver, if I could just sit at the front to use my laptop and he told me he could not let me on the bus. He instead pointed at the opened luggage compartment at the side of the bus and said I could sit there. When I finally got a new ticket he was patronising and sceptical. It was a very unpleasant experience and I have submitted a formal complaint.",03 January 2024
"It was ridiculousIt was ridiculous, on 27/12/2023 our journey was scheduled for 1 30pm to 7:20 from shudehill to victoria london. We reached victoria at 10pm something. 3 hours, i understand it was traffic and rd were busy but driver took additional 45mins break which was not mentioned in the time when we booked bus. It was too tiring amd long journey. Never gonna use it again. Also hate that megabus don't do refunds even if they are delayed or late themselves. Don't recommend it.",27 December 2023
"Journey there longJourney there long, but OK. On way back Traffic jams added over 2hours and needed extra half hour for driver break, so turned it into an 11hour journey- not your fault I know, but seats aren’t that comfy for that distance. The worst was there was no light in the toilet, so couldn’t see to flush wash hands, etc. the driver wasn’t interested and made a quip about putting money in the meter. Sorry but not funny on a 9-11 hour journey where we cannot get off to use other facilities. On board toilets need to be checked by drivers or other personal. They need to be available for use on such long journeys",27 December 2023
"I was made to wait over 2 1/2hrs when…I was made to wait over 2 1/2hrs when my bus was late. No communication from staff other to say they weren’t sure when something was coming and they would let us know when they knew, then no info for hours. No offer of compensation for terrible service, even though people like me, who has an artificial leg, were left standing for hours! Made me so late home there was no buses to get me back to my town so had to fork out for a taxi, costing me more money! Very unimpressed",27 December 2023
"Very dissatisfied.There was no toilet roll or water in the toilet. Wee everwhere inside toilet. The journey was delayed by more than 3 hours on returning journey so I was on coach from 1.30pm till 11pm. The driver was very patronising. When my stop came, i found my bags were moved to the back. I could not get them out myself, the bus driver was not onsite to help, I waited ages then another passenger helped me get my bags out by crawling in the baggage area. Very disappointed. Never travelling on Megabus again.",27 December 2023
"Toilet is extremely dirtyToilet is extremely dirty, no flushing function, bad bad smell, people pissing on the floor. No driver not care of it even after reports and complaints. Air conditioning insider the bus is too cool. Driver seems open the air conditioning level at the highest level. Other customers ask the driver to turn at  the medium level. The driver seemed not response to customers request to lower air conditioning inside the bus. It was very bad experience to take yr long journey bus. No next time to take your bus",31 December 2023
"Long distance travelWarm, clean, comfortable bus. Despite a mechanical issue, the drivers were great, kept us in the picture, and moved heaven and earth to get us to our destination on time.  Highly recommend Megabus, more regular and more convenient than the train, and half the price.",29 December 2023
"AWFULlad sat behind me had his phone strapped to my chair to watch something, he was getting notifications constantly so it was buzzing my chair every five seconds for the whole 4 hour trip. need to change the wireless charger thing so it’s not on someone else’s seat that they’ve paid for. also should make sure people are up to hygiene standards when getting on, guy in front of us had long greasy smelly hair and had it in a bobble but took it out five minutes into the journey so it smelt awful for everyone around aswell as his disgusting body odour, whilst also elbowing the lady next to him taking this bobble out his hair. then continued to be disgusting and burped in this ladies face, which absolutely stunk, followed by him constantly staring at me through the gap the whole journey. will never ride with mega bus again. appalling!!.",02 January 2024
Professionalism of the drivers was…Professionalism of the drivers was superb.y only complaint is some of the charging points that aren't not working. Outside of that it's all good experience. Buses came and left on time.,31 December 2023
"Your drivers are not professional and…Your drivers are not professional and inconsiderate. My last trip was a disaster. You Bus broke down and wS deleted for hours before a new bus came for pickup, yet your driver was stopping along the way to have a wonderful time to discuss with their colleagues why we wait, I ended up missing my flight of 6:30. Because we arrived 6:38am to victoria coach",27 December 2023
"I reached at the coach station 20…I reached at the coach station 20 minutes before departure and unfortunately my phone switched off due to low battery. I asked the staff of Megabus to please let me charge my phone so that I can show you my ticket, but he said today we have a different coach for travel from Birmingham to Manchester and we don't have a charging plug in this coach so we can't help you. show us the ticket otherwise we will not let you to travel. That was absolutely disgusting behaviour by the megabus staff and coach. When i booked the ticket why they have written that the coach have charhing plugs?",31 December 2023
"Far too hot!So the, staff / driver were great, as was the cost.But... The temperature on the bus felt like a million degrees, far to hot to be comfortable on a long journey.Think it also needs to be made clearer to people who haven't reserved a seat, to sit where they are permitted. It was like constant musical chairs at each stop.Good value but not for me.",23 December 2023
There was delay on the way and…There was delay on the way and confusion from Leeds station in respect of whether M15 was for Birmingham or not.Please the coordinators should know which bus is going or not.,27 December 2023

"This is the second time I am travelling…This is the second time I am travelling through Mega Bus and the experience was worst than the last time. Wouldn't recommend this bus service to anybody. I was charged extra money for reserving my seat, but as I reached to board I was told that anybody can sit anywhere as its an old bus and with no particular seat numbers. Also there was no charging point in the bus which is the quite basic facilities provided by all bus services at this day and age. My phone switched off and I had no way of charging my phone, after reaching leeds I had to withraw cash to book a cab for home early in the morning. The bus seating was also uncomfortable with no footrest or tray put my stuff on. Overall horrible experience again with Mega bus.",01 January 2024
"I would like to bring to your attention…I would like to bring to your attention an issue I encountered during my recent trip. I had reserved seat number 8 and paid an additional 1 pound for it. However, upon boarding, I discovered that someone was already occupying the seat and refused to relocate. I reported this to the driver, but unfortunately, my concerns were not addressed. As a result, I had to settle for a seat in the last row, which made the journey quite uncomfortable.",02 January 2024

"Despite the horrendous weather and…Despite the horrendous weather and traffic delays, mainly due to a 7 car crash on the 2nd Severn bridge the driver got us to our destination safely",27 December 2023
Poor Service.The bus was 30mins late arriving at Friary Gardens where there is only a small bus shelter and it was pouring with rain.We like many others had to to endure a 6hr journey in wet cloths.Though it was the conditions and not the drivers fault for the length of time it took to Heathrow however it was the drivers fault being late.Since you have to be at the bus stop 15mins before time we had to stand out in the rain for 45mins.Dont think I'll be using Mega Bus again. Personally I think I'd rather pay the extra and go by train.,27 December 2023
"Worst experienceWorst experience. Bus delayed but no one informed. Went to customer service counter and asked, replied very impolite by staff. Hey, I paid for the ticket, not free. Will never choose Mega Bus again.",27 December 2023

"Last timeLast time, I booked a bus from Middlesbrough to Birmingham and an emergency came up which made me not able to travel again so I chatted up support to either please refund or reschedule the dates as I usually travel with mega bus same route. Support refused and said something about terms and conditions. Even when I pleaded, I wasn’t pardoned. I actually decided I would never use mega bus. It’s not flexible at all. I also use national express and most times when something like this happens, it’s no big deal. They readjust dates with a little token and sometimes, they even refund.I was actually disappointed and sad that I had to pay for a fare I didn’t even indulge in.",31 December 2023
The bus broke down had to wait until it…The bus broke down had to wait until it was repaired making a journey that was supposed to last from 5am to 2pm entend to 10pm.Provision should be made available when such things happen by getting another megabus from the nearest megabus station where the bus broke down to covey passengers to their  destination.,27 December 2023

"I rely on wifi on arrival as a regular international visitorI live in Australia and travel to the UK annually to visit family in Bristol and when I do I travel with Megabus back and from from Heathrow. The main reason I have booked in the past is because I appreciate having access to wifi so I can contact family via what’s app when I arrive until I get to the store to buy a prepaid sim. Sadly though the wifi on Megabus did not work on my last trip in 2022/2023,nor on an earlier visit in 2021/2022. Consequently I will think twice before booking Megabus again for my next transfer.  Because again, wifi on arrival to Heathrow is incredibly useful for international travellers.I would urge Megabus to STOP advertising FREE WIFI as it is false and misleads consumers when making their purchasing decision.National Express on the other hand offer reliable wifi to travellers",03 January 2024

Absolutely been horrendousAbsolutely been horrendous. Driver 40mins late. No sorry act as not his fault. Driving like a lunatic. Talking to his mate on his phone through out the journey Cardiff to London. I pay £1each to reserve my seats 3 of them because we’re travelling with my 5yrs daughter . One guy sat in my seat but refused to move. What is the point for us to reserve our seats. It was the 11.30 to Victoria from Cardiff . I have to do this journey again in 2days time. I dearly hope we have a nicer driver.  He shouldn’t be driving for mega bus. RUDE RUDE little faces.,01 January 2024

"I have now travelled quite a few times…I have now travelled quite a few times now with Megabus. Firstly the cost to travel between Manchester and Reading to see my sister has enabled me to visit more often. I  paid as little as £40 return ticket  on a few occasions which in my view is great value.I always book a seat with extra leg room when I can for £2 which again is a bargain. The coaches on my journeys have always been clean and tidy.The coach drivers put up with a lot at times some people are not always polite. However I have found the drivers to always to be friendly and helpful. On my last trip to Reading I took a late bus. The driver was friendly and very helpful.I know the buses are not always on time , however the driver can not do anything about traffic and road works.So 9 out of 10 from meC Dewhurst",29 December 2023

DisgustingDisgusting! Women driver very rude snatched my phone to look at my tickets.Then I was told I hadn’t reserved a seat I had number 42 and 43 on my receipt. I asked where I should sit and she told me I would have to stand till a seat became available for me and my son. I am disabled.

"Everything went wrongEverything went wrong, my coach To Cardiff university was meant to be 4:45am on the 27th of December 2023, to arrive Cardiff university at 2:05pm that same day. The first problem started in Birmingham when I was change to another coach which will bring me to Cardiff university, the coach arrived at 10:50am but didn’t leave until almost 2:pm, this was due to bad wipper that needed to be change.Then we got to Bristol and driver said his shift was over and he couldn’t drive us anymore, he made us understand that the driver which was meant to change with him was nowhere to be found, mind you this was 5:15pm. He proceeded to counting we that are left in the coach and told us that he will order taxi to our final destination.This went on for another one hour and thirty minutes standing in the cold on a raining day. I finally arrived at my final destination at 8:pm with no apologies or any form of refund after making me lose my work shift for that night.It’s the worst experience I have ever had in my history of traveling with a coach.",27 December 2023

We arrived in Cyprus but no thanks to…We arrived in Cyprus but no thanks to mega bus who we had booked with to take us from Middlesbrough to Manchester airport. Our pick up was supposed to be 12.20 on 2/1 we arrived at 11.55. Three buses turned up to London Newcastle and Durham. When it was after ETA we asked the Newcastle driver who said ‘don’t worry it will be here’By 1.11 after speaking to the Durham driver who rang control and said the bus had been and gone- although he said he hadn’t seen it on the A19- we rang for a taxi. The cheapest we could get was an Uber £222 but as it was an 20 min wait and it was torrential rain/wind and there was no shelter we got another taxi back home to dry off and have a warm drink. We had no choice but to book the Uber and borrowed the money from our friend who had taken us to M’bro initially.Thankfully the Uber got us to the airport in time for the jet2 Paphos 9am flight.

"Odd route followedWas travelling from London to Manchester on the 13:00 trip and oddly the bus tracker on the Megabus site was not working for this trip, We stopped off at Heathrow on time and on arriving at Birmingham we were 5 minutes late from here driving decisions became odd, Google maps showed A38M clear along with the M6 where it joined but the the driver decided to follow the A34 to join the M6 which had delays, Shortly after joining the M6 which was congested from the junction we had joined we left, I believed maybe the driver was going to follow the A roads again but no we parked up for over 10 minutes which was confusing as this wasn’t a schedule stop but all became clear when a replacement driver arrived by which point we were now nearly 60 minutes behind schedule. What followed was akin to a white knuckle ride with the new driver trying to make time up through heavy rainfall conditions with a number of times he was forced to brake sharply followed by the driver beeping his horn and flashing his headlamps at cars that had impeded him",30 December 2023

It is absolutely ridiculous.UPDATE- mega bus sent me an apology. I informed them that n my return trip, two days later, that not only was it bitterly cold again but the bus floor was strewn with sandwich wrappers and discarded sandwich fillings.I have requested a refund but am not holding out hopeful as customer service’s line is ‘Our heating systems are checked regularly as part of our rigorous maintenance schedules and I am sorry that this fault developed whilst your vehicle was in service.’It is not good enoughThe round trip cost 45£ which was already quite expensive for a bus, and to spend 8 hours in the freezing cold merits more than a ‘sincere apology’",30 December 2023

"i did not just give will never award mega bus a single star but zero stars in multiples of 10this review because…I did not just give this review because of my last trip, but because of my trip earlier in the month, your policies to start charging customers for extra loads suck; it is not worth it at all, so you are extorting money from poor passengers that left the costly fares of trains to start using coaches. Very soon, when your fares approximate those of trains, no one will even care to use a megabus. I personally was using trains before until I saw that coaches were cheaper, I started with national express and now their fares are out of the roof, I stopped using them, now mega bus is introducing extra fares for extra loads, very soon I will switch back to trains as it is  very consistent and you will never spend 6-7 hours in the train station waiting for the next train that will take you back to your destination just like I did on 24th night, being transfered from Birmingham to Victoria and was supposed to board another coach to Reading, I paid 77 pounds for two people for that trip but I ended up waiting from 18.30pm till 12 midnight at Victoria for the coach to come, your company sucks and I should not even award you a single start but zero raised too a million powers",24 December 2023

There was no fresh air no fragrance in the bus all bus was smelling like sweat. There should be fresh air and fans working like all other buses.

"Use National Express insteadRubbish. This is my only experience of using Megabus. One trip there and then again on the return home. First trip I had was late. And then the coach driver started driving before any of us even sat down and put our stuff away. Didn't care for our wellbeing to be honest, but not enough for me to make a complaint. Then, my return journey was even worse. Left me outside in the dark waiting for the coach for over 2 hours, I was told the coach had an accident and his mirror came off. Yet, nobody informs you of this, you can't track the coaches which is ridiculous..? You can even track parcels for heavens sake, cardboard boxes. I had to speak to customer service more than once just to find out that was going on because they were being so vague with their answers but assured me I would get a refund due to my wait. All well and good but when I made a separate enquiry about the refund - apparently that's not even through Megabus and some other company called Linburg? Was told they would be in touch but not heard anything since. Rubbish service. Not even a replacement bus, no apologies, no explanations, no communication etc. Would not recommend. Quick to take your money though. You'd be safer walking on the motorway with this company.",19 December 2023

"Immoral CompanyBeing a car driver and owner I have not used a bus since 2005,I was due to collect a car from Birmingham and looked at travel options and decided to go with the bus to maximise my work flow on my laptopI arrived 30 minutes early to ensure I had no issues,Bus didn’t arrive, chased customer services, closedWaited until they opened, no tracking info for my bus just need to waitWaited for two hours, by this point the next bus should be arriving. Second bus didn’t arrive on timeI left and went to the train station, when monitoring the tracker then second bus did eventually arrive and left over 30 mins lateWhen requesting a refund this company barefaced lied and said the bus arrived and operated on time but was the only bus that day to not be tracked and logged that dayNo matter the evidence i shared it was refused, seems Monzo where happy with it all as they took the money back.Immoral company who only exist due to the prices, the cheapest option rarely appealsto me but Liked the idea of a big comfy bus to get some work done and not hopping multiple trains. Never again",30 October 2023
No communication only cancellationsCoach to the airport was cancelled with no notification or communication.Customer service had no clue about when a replacement would come.The driver who was parked in a car near by to take over the coach that was supposed to arrive was rude and dismissive of the passengers stuck outside in the rain.,21 December 2023

"Great ticket price but ignorant driverI liked the price of my return ticket - and ease of booking. Unfortunately my bus arrived late and, on the outbound journey, I found the driver to be somewhat rude and ignorant. Some of us on the bus were hot, and some (towards the back of the bus) were far too cold. People stated this to the driver and were met with a shrug and a comment of “Can’t help ya, no idea what’s going on!” The return journey was ok, although there was a delay that wasn’t explained to us and, instead of arriving back at 2.30am, we arrived back at approx 3.30am. There seemed to have been some sort of diversion off the M1, but nobody explained or apologised.",12 December 2023

"Disgusting service and will never use Megabus againIf I could leave 0 stars I would. I bought tickets for my family to get from Heathrow to Manchester on 17th December. They arrived on time for the bus but were promptly told by the driver that they had too many bags and needed to purchase extra tickets. I had already purchased an extra ticket to account for their luggage as most of the luggage is classed as medium size. They begged him to let them use the bus WiFi to buy another ticket as their phones were almost all dead and had no access to data having just arrived in the UK, but he said not until they purchased a ticket (they already had 4 tickets for 3 people!?) Then he got aggressive and demanded they buy 2 extra tickets. There were 2 other ladies with less bags than my family who he demanded they buy 5 extra seats. What an absolute scam!!! I plan to report this to the relevant authority because it was absolutely disgraceful and completely uncalled for. My family were literally crying and begging to be helped and he just left them behind without even bothering to help at all.",17 December 2023

I was forced to beg an Uber driver to take me to manchester Airport.  It was a nightmare.  When I asked the driver he said he didn't stopped and that I should board the couch if I wanted to get to the airport.  Tks God he drove to Birmingham and we chandriver.  Him and his assistant were nice humain and helpfulThe first one was crap I HAD THE MUST DISTRESSING EXPERIENCE EVER.

I was meant to change coach at Glasgow bus station but I was racially abused and also was not allowed to join the coach to London and the excuse given was that there’s no room for my luggage so I was left out in the cold.  One of the worst experience I ever had in my life, my mental health was tampered with and also had to get another ticket with national express before I could get to London.  I am really disappointed and I hope something can be done about this.  I cried and wept bitterly at the Glasgow bus station.  This is far from good from Mega bus staffs. They need to do better",17 December 2023

I got a return ticket from London Victoria to Birmingham Brunel Street. Very easy to navigate, central locations and managed to get to and from London with minimal delays. The only issues I had were that the plug point was not working near my seat and regarding the handling of my bag, on getting down at Victoria, I found that the wheel had broken off. However, there were a lot of people in the bus and it was quite possible to have broken off by getting jostled around.Overall, the Megabus experience was a very pleasant experience and I fully recommend it.",09 December 2023

I was wearing a long sleave shirt, a woolen pullover, a tweed jacket and a duffle coat - and I was so cold that I could not rest. After about 2 hours, one of the passengers asked the driver to turn the heat up and he obliged. But given that everybody downstairs was dressed in winter coats, I was astonished that the driver needed to be asked. On my return journey (Saturday morning 9 December, Newcastle to Dunbar), there was a similar issue. I was upstairs, and again I was extremely cold. In winter, why don't the drivers turn the heating on as a matter of course? Otherwise, the trips were good. But the cold made them very uncomfortable.",03 December 2023

"Heartless, callous and money grabbing.I turned up for my coach within the departure window only to have a megabus worker callously shut the station door in my face, I then spoke to her and she, without any empathy or care told me to go away and wouldn’t let me on despite the coach doors still being open and then sitting there for another 5 minutes whilst she walked around laughing and joking. I then had to buy another ticket for a later coach and then meant I had to travel at night. Megabus staff had no empathy, care or regard and whilst I was waiting the next 3 hours for the next coach I saw several people have the same issue and the same workers turn countless people away without a single care. This is so wrong. People were turning up before the departure time only to have the door shut in their faces by heartless workers who just don’t care. This whole endeavour seems like a money grabbing ploy to get people to have to buy more tickets that are already too expensive and is clear that megabus don’t care about their customers. Will be avoiding megabus at all cost in the future.",10 December 2023

While looking for the 8 pm bus online I asked Jack what time the bus will arrive at the destination he told me he was busy and could not help he was standing next to his colleague in silence. I responded you just read from that clipboard a moment ago can’t you read it again and he said no and walked away smirking. His colleague assisted. I have worked in customer service 6 / 9 years I’ve been working. Your staff need to learn customer service.

"Megabus from OxfordBus, driver, price, journey to Glasgow all fine. But surprisingly the Oxford departure point is misleading and unclear. It says City Centre and elsewhere Parkway. The former would suggest a city bus stop or Gloucester Green. The later refers to a railway station outside Oxford (beyond the ring road, actually in Kidlington, and definitely not city centre). To confuse matters further the website listed several stops for Oxford, and Parkway was listed under ""NOT IN USE"".  We were advised by the chat line to use Parkway - but there was no signage there for megabus  nor are its arrivals featured on the screens.   Surely a very basic aspect of running a bus company is to make it very clear where the departure is from and to ensure that departure point is well signed. As it turned out Parkway was correct, which, as I say, is NOT oxford city centre.",02 December 2023

"Bad service — stick to National ExpressTimetable does not get updated a Heathrow Central Bus Station, staff at the station had no idea as to why the service was delayed and couldn’t give any further details as they did not work for Megabus.The service was not trackable online, and in the end several customers were waiting for at least half an hour with no idea as to whether the service would actually arrive. Calling Megabus was ineffective, as I kept on hold and didn’t get out through to an operator.When the coach finally arrived, the seat reservations were not upheld and the did not match the layout presented on the booking site, making the paid seat reservation totally pointless. There was also a total lack of Wi-Fi.When I emailed to complain about the timetable, I was told that they didn’t run the timetable and that it was the fault of the bus station — this is an issue that Megabus needs to own and deal with proactively.This was my first time using Megabus, and I won’t be doing so again. National Express had up to date travel information and a far more comprehensive service.",08 December 2023

"Gatwick MegamessI bought a ticket from Megabus for travel from Gatwick to Heathrow. The Megabus stop is very obvious at Gatwick South: it is the first stop you see when descending the ramp from Arrivals. Stop 6 has a big Megabus sign, 3 concrete posts next to it have Megabus signage, and the yellow and black official airport signage also says Megabus is at stop 6.”That’s easy!” I thought… until I saw the bus to Heathrow sailing by. ignoring my gesticulations. It turns out Megabus uses another company for this service that stops somewhere else at Gatwick. Two other people were waiting at the same stop as me at the same time for the same bus. However, Megabus does not see this as a problem and refused any form refund. Apparently 3 paying (former) customers being left stranded is all fine. If they don’t want to lose more customers they should look at their signage at Gatwick, a small notice at their stop would be all that is required to fix this.",03 December 2023

"Could do better to keep passengers updatedLack of information or updates while waiting for a bus that was 1 hour and 30 minutes delayed. No updates online, via twitter or on the screens in Victoria Coach Station. Better communication is required to keep people updated, either by email, or via message. This should be easy to set up and would give reassurance and peace of mind to passengers especially after 6pm when your customer services close.Replacement coach did not offer reservations or the additional leg room I had paid extra for and made or a very uncomfortable 5 hour journey.",01 December 2023

I am also yet to receive a refund since I didn't make use of the ticket.Secondly, my journey to London from Aberdeen was terrible as we started off early but arrived very late and there wasn't any form of apologies for the late arrival or any notification that we would arrive late and I ended up missing a connecting bus I was supposed to join to arrive my destination which happened to be the last bus for that day and so I ended up sleeping in the bus station.",07 December 2023

"never againI've booked direct bus from London to Manchester which usually takes around 5 hours, departure at 3pm. The bus was delayed so staff told us to jump to the next bus at 4:30 pm, however no one told us, the second bus goes longer way (should take around 7 hours with stops at some cities-at the end it was also delayed because of road traffic). No communication from the staff about what;s going on, where we are going and how long it will take. Finally instead of arriving in Manchester at 8pm I've arrived 1am another day. If someone have told me before, i would still wait for my first delayed bus, because even with longer delay - it'd probly arrive faster.",07 December 2023

Me and my girlfriend asked to leave early at Heathrow in order to avoid missing our plane, as the plan previously was to have a bite to eat in London and then go to Heathrow.The staff on the bus refused to let us take our bags off, even though other passengers were disembarking, as we had not payed the extra to go to Heathrow. He was rude and swore at another customer, saying it was company policy to not let us off the bus.Additional delays meant we were only just on time for our plane to Boston.All in all this was a horrible experience, and I will never use this company again.",07 December 2023

"I booked through Megabus to use their…I booked through Megabus to use their third party service the South West Falcon which takes you from Plymouth to Bristol airport. My family had booked this service at 3am on the 29th October to take us to Bristol Airport for our early morning flight. We waited for an hour for this coach which never showed up and ended up rushing home to grab the car and drive up luckily just making our flight in the nick of time. Since our holiday we've been in correspondence with Megabus who claim to their very last breath that the coach did show up and it was us who missed it! After many, many emails and phone calls and us not getting anywhere with them they finally sent me an attachment of the times it left each stop before ours and when it got to ours. How unfortunate it was for us that at 2am on the 29th the clocks went back and the coach arrived at the first stop just before 2am and left so many minutes later just past 2am and therefore the coach was now operating an hour ahead of schedule before it even got to our stop. Do Megabus want to admit to this..? No they don't. Though proof is in the pudding. I ended up appealing this with Bus Users UK who helped me get back my money back on the bookings however, doesn't cover the cost that we lost in short notice airport parking. I've used this Falcon service many times in the past with no issues and now I wont use them again which is a shame as the coach is very convenient and cheaper. But I trust my car to get me there more then a coach service which cant tell between GMT time zone and GMT+1.",29 October 2023

Customer services at Megabus said they will not pay me back this money because this was only 30 minutes delay. They are liars. They only give back money for more than 120minutes delay. So am I supposed stay 2 hours in a bus stop, in the freezing cold, even when I dont get a text message when to expect the bus? Rubbish service, and rubbish customer service.

"AppallingAppalling. After 35mins, bus hadn’t arrive. Had to get to London for first day of new job so taxied to rail station and paid £110 for train ticket. Contacted Megabus to be told bus arrived after 30mins - it didn’t, I was still at bus stop at this time. Also told no refund as bus arrived within 120mins - totally out of touch with other transporters. Also told, as bus was plain white, I may have missed it! - excuse me?! Also, the tracking app does not work so you cannot know if the bus is en-route to you or it has been cancelled prior to your pick-up. Advice - I would avoid at all costs. Cheap and no frills is one thing but with NO contact phone number and NO BUS (in reasonable timeframe), Megabus cutbacks have gone a step too far.",06 December 2023

Bad experienceOn the outward journey it was an old bus and the trip was extremely uncomfortable and the bus was way too hotOn both outward and return journeys we paid 3 each for 2 seats to reserve seat and on both buses they didn’t reserve our seats and either were no numbers on seats or people were already sitting in our seats this caused my partner undue stress as he’s an anxious traveler and needs to sit next to me which is why we reserved seats in the first place,01 December 2023

Not a great experienceOn my way to London Victoria from Swansea on the Megabus on the 30th of November 2023 there was 3 young boys sitting behind me were drinking alcohol and being very loud and not being considerate of the other passengers on the coach.These young guys behind me were not only consuming alcohol they were also vaping and causing lots of anti social behaviour for the whole journey.I also did not feel safe on the journey.I also want to add on the 30th of November on my journey to London Victoria from Swansea bus Station was the driver was supposed to pick us up from 10:20 in the morning and the driver was 10 minutes late with no apology.I found the driver to also be very unprofessional in his manner too not very polite.So sadly overall the journey was quite unsettling.Please note that it is against the Megabus Policy and Procedure for people to consume Alcohol or smoke.,30 November 2023
"Good journey, but poor ""missing items"" processGood journey. A couple of interactions I had with drivers were pleasant.Complaint: a narrow gap in between the window and the hand rail was enough for my glove to fall down, and into a place where it was not possible to get it back from. There was no net to prevent items falling, nor signs to warn that this could be a problem. No doubt phones would be dropped down here often. ""Lost items"" refer you to a 3rd party website, meaning the bus company takes no liability for their complacency.",03 December 2023

The bus was extremely cold it was minus1 when we got on I jokingly said to the driver I hope it’s warm on the bus he shrugged and said he hadn’t been upstairs. I sat down at the back of the bus and immediately could feel there was not any heating on, other passengers were also complaining, when we stopped at Southampton Airport my friend spoke to the driver about putting the heating on noting the cabin he was in was warm and cosy, he said it takes a while to warm up but strangely there was some heat but only on one side of the bus so everyone moved to the right side. I made a note of the bus registration number YY65 VXT. I again complained to the driver about the cold temperature for the duration of the journey to Oxford.At 1500 on Sunday my return journey the same driver pulled in to the bus station I asked straight away if he got the heating sorted out and he told me it was a different bus but I knew the registration number and told him so, however the bus was warm for the journey home.I wonder if the bus was faulty or he just didn’t bother to put the heating on.I have used the Megabus several times and I have be satisfied with my journey except for this time, the toilet was smelly and dirty being we were the first passengers leaving from Portsmouth it clearly had not been clean.",02 December 2023

I ended up missing my bus and was told by another Stagecoach driver I was on the wrong side. There is nothing in the confirmation email, website, or timetable relating to where to wait other than the road the stop is on, which is very long. I've been told I have to send an email to make a complaint - only to have to wait 14 days to get a response. I have wasted an entire day, taxi fare, and will miss my appointment tomorrow because of Megabus' cock up. When I called back the same customer service representative told me she couldn't hear me - ask me to repeat the question then - I made it very clear I needed to know what stop I needed to wait at. I don't know how providing me with information about the incorrect stop answers any question other than 'what stop don't I wait at?'",04 December 2023

They came across very rude. I respect that nothing could be about traffic but not knowing what was going on was very stressful. I didn't get the seat I booked but did get the £3 back. The coach tracker app wasn't helpful because I wasn't able to track my coach. It was freezing so I am now ill.

I implored further and further stated my reason due to the condition of the toilet but he said I could as well get my bags off the coach and go use the toilet and I shouldn’t expect to meet the coach when I get bad.

The power he feels he thinks he has funny. I have videos and some the conversation. No hot food on the coach. As it smells. No alcohol on the coach even duty free had to be stored in the luggage section. Some people's cases where full and the duty free was on a bag. So it wasn't secure.Seat belts must be worn at all times while travelling (fair enough but don't get funny when people go to toilet haha). To tell a woman she had too much luggage when the coach wasn't even half full. But he did say I would let her off this time. Omg. Raine it in and his speeches. Well to die for.

Sadly, by paying for reserved seating we were on the second row and the wiper blades were hitting the side of the screen. It was a very rainy day so we had to endure the loud flack-flack sound for the whole journey. Also, there is a distance warning bell that alerts the driver to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. This bell sounds like a phone ringing and was just as annoying as the wiper blades.The other disappointment for us is that only occasionally does the Megabus come into Rugby town itself to pick up or drop off, so the taxi fare from Rugby to the Rugby Moto Services, Junction One on the M6 adds another £12 to our journey.",03 December 2023

Well, try better Megabus.Be aware Megabus will sell you the ticket even if they know the service is massively delayed up to the moment the service is due to depart.I bought the ticket at 16.40 for 17.20 bus while the service was already 1hour 37 minutes delayed.A quote from Megabus:“Tickets are sold up until the moment the service is due to depart, this has always been the case with the megabus website, however we can certainly feed this back to the relevant team that you feel this is not appropriate.I apologise once again for the inconvenience caused by this, however as advised due to the terms & conditions we would be unable to offer any refund on this occasion.Kind regards,RachelCustomer Service”I am aware delays can happen due to traffic but it is inappropriate not to inform the customers in case of long delays and it is inappropriate to sell the tickets for the service which is already massively delayed and will not leave at the stated time.",30 November 2023
"No longer cheap, and no more cheerful.Delays, delays, delays.Setting off from Edinburgh, our bus (which was half and hour late already) decided to break down. No communication from the driver as we pulled up. In fact, we only learnt we would be sat there for about 3 hours after another passenger called customer services and put them on loud speaker. I had to get off, walk to the train station and pay for the inconvenience.In fact, even when I applied for a refund the reply was 'we experience delays because of traffic' which this was not. And that they would refund it 'as a gesture of good will.' Well no actually, you violated your own policy and so had to refund me. Get off your high horse and read your own policy.Just a rubbish service. On the way back, there were again massive delays. But at least they got me there. Two hours late, with a ringing in my ear from the squeaking, streaking feedback on the speakers. But back. And I guess that's the main thing? Right? RIGHT?I dare not write to customer services again for a refund on that trip in case they tell me how I should just be lucky to be alive and my expectations are just too high. Maybe they are right. But they couldn't be lower now. So I guess I learnt my lesson. Thanks Mega Bus!",01 December 2023

"Pathetic Ride from Newcastle to MiddlesbroughWe booked 2 seats with Megabus to travel from Newcastle to Middlesbrough on 1st Dec, 2023. Pathetic service: as the bus was scheduled to leave at 10:55pm however, it CAME so late at 11:35PM with no any prior notice and just left right away. We boarded asap and the bus was cold (temperature was -5 already). First, we had to stand outside waiting for the bus in -5 to -7 temperature as bus was late and then the bus itself did not have any heating inside. So many passengers kept going to the driver to ask to turn on the heating and he told everyone the same thing that “it’s building on”. He kept saying that pls wait and bus will be okay but it actually just went even colder. He turned on the exhausts and I caught cold and fever afterwards! There’s no-one to answer calls or respond in customer service after 6pm and since our ride was late at night so no-one could get in touch to help. I would think 100 hundred times to book again with Megabus. All other buses like Flixbus etc. kept arriving at their exact times but megabus turned out to be pathetic! Would not recommend!!!",01 December 2023

"Use a a last resortMy Son's experience was a few months ago, but having read the reviews I felt this needed adding. His Aviemore to Edinburgh leg was delayed, but the connection to Leeds was still there, so great! However, the return leg was a disaster. The bus due from Leeds was delayed over an hour but based on the previous leg we didn't panic. However, we got a late night call when he got to Edinburgh to inform us his connection had left before they'd arrived. The result was a £200 taxi fare to Aviemore and arrival at 0300. We will never use or recommend again - he is preferring the 7.5 hour drive this year.",27 December 2022

"Had enough tbhThe price of the tickets, along with the friendly drivers (most of the time) is the only reason this isn’t one star. I never write bad reviews because for me to go out of my way to speak negatively about my experience it has to be awful, and I’ve had enough. I’ve used megabus plenty of times, and every single time there’s issues (except once which genuinely really surprised me). The coaches are late 9/10 times, the wireless charging never works, the charging port works I’d say 75% of the time, the seats are always semi clean at best. As I speak there’s 2 pieces of gum on the seat in front of me and I got on at the first stop so no excuse for that, and the coach in general is never really clean. Another thing with megabus is that whenever they get a review involving constructive feedback, they just give excuses and I’ve never actually take these criticisms on board. Maybe if they did they wouldn’t have too many bad reviews with similar experiences. I’m a long time user and have given plenty of chances, but honestly at this point I’d rather spend the little extra on national express so I don’t repeatedly get an experience that feels like a joke. As I said the drivers and prices are the only things these guys have got going for them.",28 November 2023

"Megabus system faultMegabus is a competitive coach company it network covers most cities in UK.  However, the arrival time is not on time and the control of reserved seat always occupies by other passengers.Besides the online booking is not good enough I reserved two seats with debited reserved payment but the system issue two normal seat tickets, and which could not be rectified, it’s better to upgrade the system and correction function applied.",23 October 2023

Poor communication gapBad experience on 16/11/23 journey of 3hours turn to 12hrs. We are meant to return from Sheffield to Sunderland @6:50. The bus driver checked our ticket which is trip to Sunderland and said we can go in but to my surprise the bus headed to London Victoria coach station. The driver was changed in the middle of the road. Although the new driver was helpful saying he has talk to the office and they will provide a solution. Meeting the customer service staffs which they tried to help but the solution is that we join the bus going to Newcastle and is meant to arrive 9:15 the next day. I was angry 😡 about this cos I have to do school runs the next morning. To cut the long story we join National Express to Sunderland which arrives 7:25. I am not happy at all.,16 November 2023

Why wasn't the website showing the correct information?Being able to catch that bus would have saved us the 5 hour plus wait in a freezing cold airport bus station.The driver of the next bus being a bell end didn't help the matter.This journey was not a good one, unlike the others we have taken.

"Coach delayDear Company Management,I would like to express my dissatisfaction and complaint regarding my recent journey on your company's bus. I took a ride on your company's bus on the evening of 18 Nov., and unfortunately, this experience left me very dissatisfied.Firstly, the departure time of the bus was significantly delayed. The scheduled departure time was 19:30, but in reality, we didn't depart until 20:40. This delay caused me to arrive home late, causing inconvenience in my daily life.Secondly, I was disappointed with the service on this journey. The seats on the bus were not comfortable, and the interior was not very clean. I had expected to have a pleasant journey on the bus but felt quite uncomfortable.I understand that delays can sometimes be unavoidable, but I believe your company can take measures to improve the service and reduce delays. I hope your company will seriously consider my feedback and take steps to enhance the service quality, ensuring that customers can have a better travel experience.",18 November 2023

The bus arrived at Manchester airport, as it was late the driver was just going to go,it was only because we panicked and asked if it was our bus that we got on. The driver didn’t go into the waiting area to inform people where he was going. We were told to wait at A.B.or C. It was very cold so we were inside the waiting area. We had waited over 30 mins and were very tired as we had been on a long haul flight we got concerned and checked. There was a lady,husband and 2 small children that needed to get off at Birmingham but all had fallen asleep they did not realise they should of got off at the stop before Cheltenham. There had been no instruction as to where the bus was stopping. This family then had to wait for another bus to pick them up from Cheltenham to go back to Birmingham. Their baby.

If it is not possible to remove  the staining etc, then for the sake of hygiene, replace them.The broken panels that cover the electronics at the front of the upper deck need to be correctly and safely repaired.

"Bitter ExperienceI booked a trip for my wife from Heathrow to leeds (10/11/2023), on getting to Victoria, she was told to buy 2seats extra because she was having 2extra luggage whereas it's there on the ticket £10 for extra bag. Their reason was that it's a long ride and passengers are waiting at various locations and they might have luggage, that paying £10 per bag isn't a guarantee to carry someone with extra luggage. Honestly it's a total rip off and am not happy about it. I paid £26 for the trip and £60 for luggage which is totally absurd. As a Matter of fact, my card was declining and I have to give a stranger £60 cash for her to use her card to book that extra 2 seats. Am so mad about this experience, it's her 1st time traveling and this experience you gave her and me, isn't pleasant. Please look into this and kindly give me my appropriate refund.

When the time came closer I tracked it again and it was 10 mins or so away, I checked every mega bus that came in and the other person was too, the tracker kept changing so it was always a minute or two difference in real time, on this occasion I checked the new bus arrival and nope not our bus, the other guy commented its still a few minutes away and we laughed about it, I went in the depot and checked, it said departed, with this the guy came in and said the same thing to me, I found mega bus number, the woman I spoke to said it was on time and has left and that we had to buy another ticket, i said this bus never turned up so why should we but another ticket, then this other guy said its the 2nd time this company has done this to him, so basically you pay for a service and the don't up hold their end, I think the truth is they were behind schedule skipped the Pick up to gain time for the other pick ups, it's a disgusting service with no help from their customer service team.",11 November 2023
"Horrendous, huge delay, no explanation, no refundsHorrendous.  Gave up waiting for bus from Northampton to Nottingham and got the train because it clearly just hadn't left London and was tracking later and later.  Paid for alerts but there were no relevant alerts or explanations just that it is now expected 3 hours later. Website says no refunds for any delays.",11 November 2023
"Mixed Emotions riding to London and back to BristolThe ride from Bristol to London was really bad.1. The driver stopped halfway to London at some seemingly random place, got out of the bus and came back with a coffee and took a smoke break. All of this would have been fine, if he only mentioned something to the passengers/us.2. He started to drive exceedingly rough as we came closer to London, breaking in a ""rocking fashion"" and turning very abruptly.But then the bus driver going back to Bristol gave us an excellent experience. He gave a short introduction/greeting before leaving the bus station and drove very nice and smooth all the way to the very end.",06 November 2023
"Booked this journey as the coach didn't show up the day beforeI booked this seat on the Bristol to Oxford coach, 10.10.  I had planned to travel the day before, but waited two hours for a coach that did not appear.  However, on the 7th the bus left dead on time, arrived on time, and the journey was very comfortable.  However, still very disappointed about the previous day.",07 November 2023
"Stay away from this company!!!Ive waited more than 40 minutes and coach didn't appear, had to take a taxi to get my flight on time.Megabus replied to me with their t&c, only refund for the cancellation of a service or for delays over 120 minutes.Disgusting!!!",07 November 2023

"Newcastle to London-returnI made a return journey from Newcastle to London . All went very well on my journey down ,it was comfortable and prompt. Returning my coach did not arrive on time and in was not trackable on the app. I therefore purchased tickets for the following bus . My first bus then arrived 1hr 40 mins late which was  not a problem i understand the traffic can determine this ,my concern was that i was unable to track the bus .On returning home i emailed and requested a refund for the ticket for the later bus ,i got a very prompt reply and my cost was fully refunded very promptly.I would use this service again as it was comfortable with helpful drivers and affordable . The bus was late on return journey but that was out of the control of megabus and has to be expected",26 October 2023
"Price is excellentI think price is excellent. Access was great. Comfortable enough.The extra £1 for txt msg was a waste of time as the bus ran 2 hrs late and no msg was received. Luckily wasn't a problem to my follow on travel connections.I would have preferred the drunk passenger, especially when loud and at times aggressive (accidentally pulled my hair 3 times getting up and down out of his seat), to have been spoken to by staff and not be left to the wonderful passengers who dealt with him. That said, all in all, not a terrible experience.Would definitely use again.",03 November 2023

"Swansea to London overnightSwansea to London 11.20 pm (27/10/2023) to 5.35 am (28/10/2023)Swansea to Cardiff was one coach and had to change coaches at Cardiff to get to London, no alert just the driver said last minute as we reached Cardiff. Is this what you call professionalism?Swansea to Cardiff didn't even feel like a coach, it had squeaking seats, no air con, no reclining and noisy environment and windows.Cardiff to London was a bit better, air con here and there although not continuously, seats were much better standard.But it is not worth the price you're going to pay for this particular trip. Ultimately a scam of £18 considering what service I got and a really rough overnight travel.In the end, I would like to never trust Megabus ever again as National Express and Flixbus are more professional and reliable in their services.",27 October 2023

Rude staff and given wrong informationWe had an email about the journey back saying that the departure stop had been changed. We found out where this was and made sure we was there with plenty of time to spare. It came to the time and I saw the coach approaching the original stop so my partner had to run to the coach. The driver was rude and said to my boyfriend u should be here I would have just left you and said if I didn't hurry up hence I am disabled and walk with crutches that the coach would leave without me.I was very unimpressed with the service has I had rung up the day before to check it still was the new stop we had been given.,05 November 2023

"Poor ServiceI am contacting you regarding a massive inconvenience that had been caused by Megabus. Yesterday, I arrived at the bus stop 30 minutes earlier for me to be able to catch the coach on time, the coach never arrived and only arrived 1 hour 15 minutes later whilst I have been waiting in the extreme cold the whole time.Eventually it has arrived and I had to sit in the most uncomfortable position I have ever in my entire life. I had to transfer in London for my next coach, however this was not possible because the coach did not make it on time for my next coach, we arrived in London Victoria when my next coach had already left. I was left stranded in London, and I had a very important personal matter to tend to, but I couldn’t make it to Bristol on time.I had to come up with an alternative way to get to Bristol. There were also other additional modes of transportation arranged upon arrival in Bristol but all that had gone to waste because of Megabus and additionally, nobody bothered to assist when I tried to get help. I had to make means.I am very disappointed in the quality of service that I received and I would never wish this kind of service to anyone. I am requesting for a full refund for my trip and any method of reimbursement that Megabus deems suitable for this kind of experience, even though it will not fix all that I have experienced, I just think that it is unfair for my money to be just taken after going through what Megabus put me through.",05 November 2023

We normally travel on National Express services, but decided to give Megabus a chance.The service was delayed by 1:45 hours meaning we would have missed our flight. Whilst I understand that there can be issues beyond Megabus 's control, the least your company could have done is sent an email or an SMS message to warn us as soon as you became aware of the delay.There was no screen with departure information (and the printed departure board is well out of date). No announcement was made and I only found out by chance that the service is delayed badly.In the end we managed to catch our flight, but only because it was delayed.No refund was provided by Megabus.

Over an hour lateThe coach was over 30 mins late and Not trackable. Then we had to stop for 30 mins at services for his break. Meaning it was over an hour late arriving. I left work an hour early to get this coach which was pointless as the one leaving an hour after (5.30) actually arrived earlier than the one I was on (4.30).,03 November 2023
"I am really disappointed in megabus.I am really disappointed in megabus.I booked megabus on 30th October for a journey from Reading to Victoria coach station, London at 8:00 pm. I waited close to two hours and the bus wasn't showing up.There was no communication to passengers on that day as to what has really happened.I called megabus to find out and they kept giving me hope which wasn't true.I had to reach London before 10:30 to take my next national express bus to middlesbrough.I was frustrated so I had to book train which cost me more than I expected.Megabus has poor customer service and I will not recommend to any of my family and friends.I will rather resort to national express as they keep their time than megabus.Bad service.",30 October 2023

"I purchased round-trip bus tickets for travelI purchased round-trip bus tickets for a journey from Birmingham to Cambridge on November 3rd. The departure went smoothly with the bus arriving on time, and the boarding location was easy to find.However, the return journey presented some challenges. It was quite difficult to locate the designated waiting area, and to add to the inconvenience, the bus was delayed by over 20 minutes. Due to our uncertainty about the accuracy of the waiting area, I was constantly anxious during the wait, worrying that I might miss the bus because I wasn't at the correct location. Moreover, the return trip was scheduled for 9:00 PM, and it was impossible to reach the company's customer service for reassurance. Finding an alternative mode of transportation at that time of night was exceptionally challenging.Additionally, I was unsure about how to ascertain the reason for the bus delay, and I had no way to confirm whether the bus had been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.As a result, the overall experience on the return journey was less than satisfactory.",03 November 2023

This creates anxiety for me personally when booking.,28 October 2023
"Brilliant driverWhilst on the bus, 4 men tried to get on, there was trouble with their tickets, not entirely sure of the story but the driver had to refuse entry. This led to the driver getting a lot of verbal abuse from these men and also they started getting physical, kicking the bus etc. Felt awful for the driver but as the only two passengers, two females in their twenties, we felt unable to step in. Driver made us feel comfortable and safe the whole time and checked on us afterwards. He dealt with it like a pro. I feel this driver needs recognition for his service. Cannot thank him enough. He was driving the 3.30am bus from Cardiff to Birmingham on 29/10/23. Other than the driver, the bus was comfortable and journey was smooth, thank you.",29 October 2023

"Total disasterTotal disaster ! Departing coach broke down b4 it could even board us on. Replacement bus toilet wouldn’t flush, no toilet paper, no hand wash available, no running water ! Although paid to reserve seats, driver insisted we sat right next to stinking toilet for 8 hrs. Returned trip just as bad. Got there 2 hrs early yet coach left 30 mins late. Forced everyone to sit upstairs like sardines, boiling hot, some slept on floor with smelly feet in my face all night. Driver forced us all to remove bags off seat staring “ Bus was full” yet Downstairs half seat were empty some even had 2 seats together unoccupied, cool air conditioning on downstairs. Hatch above constantly leaked rain onto me all night long. My head shoulder & bum was wet. I complained to driver when he stopped to refuel only & asked why I can’t move seat downstairs. He was nasty attitude & ordered me back upstairs stating I hadn’t reserved the seat. He ignored my issue with getting soaked with the leek & he said it “ Wasn’t rain but condensation “ Ad if that makes a difference when ur wet all night ! I suggested I move myself downstairs but he got aggressive & said if I did this then  He would “ remove me off the seat “ And that the bus wouldn’t start again until I got back in me seat. Nasty terrible experience for me & my 3 young sons . On of which is disabled with down’s syndrome. Never again",29 October 2023

"Rude coach staff, Bad experience, lost of money and bad customer serviceDear Mega bus,I am highly disappointed and dissatisfied in your services to be honest and i dont think i can ever board or advise anyone close to me  book a coach with your company.Firstly , i booked a ticket for me and my family (4 travellers) and we are entitled to carry a particular amount of kg of loads. We are 4 and we had 4 luggages on getting to your station at shudehill your staff declined and insisted we cannot travel with the load bcos 2 were packed in a traveling sack. We got to the bus station an hour ahead of time ,however , the driver drove off in our presenceeven after lots of begging couple with having small kids and infant. The bus left us and drove off we were told that we cannot travel becos the load was in a sack unless we let go of our luggages and i kept wondering what happend to my previous 30pounds just for your staff to say that the money is not refundable. I agree to have read this online that money paid for tickets are non refundable however I think the service is quite not flexible, too harsh and driver and other staff so rude and not welcoming because how can all the funds be non refundable it actually not too good as a service provider it not easy to get money. I expected that even when a customer have this kind of challenges they should be an opportunity to amend and add a fee to join another despite that your staff and driver intentionally left us becos of our luggages. We wanted to even join another bus but to no effect and previous money gone.I am really pained because i and my family suffered and we couldnt get a refund to even book another bus to our destination .We were stranded at the station and the experinece was really awful with my little babies in the cold. The staff were not accomodating and not ready to listen to any thing . My experience was really bad as i have to be in the cold looking out for help.",30 October 2023

The driver/ female driverThe driver/ female driver. I forgot my charger inside the bus and one of Mega bus driver took me where the bus I was using or that brought me to London was parked. I tried to speak to the lady but she just closed the windows ran inside the back / where passengers sit. She didn’t not want to hear what I was knocking or came there for. I went to speak to a National Express driver to ask is he could try and speak to the Mega bus driver and I explained everything to him. I thought she saw me and she came out from where she was hiding inside the bus and shouted at me “WHAT; What What do you want ; I am on my official break and allowed to not talk to you “ . That was so scary and I was kind of like what’s wrong but I came down and apologised for disturbing his break but I will not have enough money to buy another iPhone 14Pro charger. I explained to her and that if she can allow me to get my charger and I would go and leave her alone. She shouted and said go in its opened now. I went in and took my charger. It took only 30 seconds to go and out but it took 5 minutes to try to get it or to talk to her even that being shouted. I didn’t mind since I wanted my charger. That’s was so embarrassing; humiliating and disrespected.I really wish some other customers will not experience this situation. The bus was from Derby to London Victoria and It was 17:00 from Derby bus station.Thank to the gentleman that was driving Megabus from Bristol if I’m not mistaken/ I think that’s what he said and other gentleman from National Express 🙏🏿,29 October 2023

"Expecting my reserved seat to be clean and empty. !!!?Hi there , I don’t understand why I pay for the reservation of the seat ? Let me explain myself, the last few times I got your coach I reserved the seat at the front but every time I’m getting  the coach someone else is seating on my seat and this people got no reservations and they moved from my seat that by the way she wet it and there were pieces of crisps , bread and food all over my seat , the girl couldn’t care less and she got upset that she needed to move ( bad attitude) from my seat and simply her and one friend moved on the next reserved seat , I asked her if she got a reservation and she said no . I pay for  the reservation of my seat all the time and for what when I got people seating on my seat dirty and wetting it and make my journey very uncomfortable right from the start. You can do something about it and is not hard to do so . Your driver should check the reservation every time he stops and to let people know is not fare to seat on other people seat if they are doing it. I love your coach but not like that  I paid for the seat and I’m expecting my seat to be clean and dry and not with lots of smelly food and wet . Another time a black lady she didn’t wanted to move from my seat,  she moved because the driver told her to do so . I don’t need this dramas especially when I got nearly 4 hours to travel. You have a good day now.",30 October 2023

"WEAR THERMALS,I travelled 2 weeks ago on a freezing 3 hour journey,  there were 14 passengers all of which were freezing, along with no charging point in 3 of the seats we tried.   We all complained about the cold.  The drivers reason,after an hour of travelling was, the bus needs to still warm up!  Megabus answered the email i sent, but nothing new, only that they maintain their buses and that the driver had tried to reset the heater... anyway having booked my second trip for before these issues, I hoped not to have put up with these problems again.  Journey there was good,  however the 3 hour journey back was cold, with constant cool air blowing,  everyone was making sure their vents were in an off position, having spent time at our destination,  our phones were flat, unbelievable not one charging port was working. We checked every seat on the coach none were working,  none were lit up with the blue light, we asked others no one could get them to work.   I have looked and for £1 extra National Express offer the same trip, so in future I will be using them.   They also have parking close by, which UWE Bristol does not, so it makes the trip so much more expensive,  as need to catch a taxi to the megabus stop. You would think Megabus could negotiate some kind of paid parking spaces.",27 October 2023
Absolutely rubbish serviceAbsolutely rubbish service - I did not get reserved seat No.70 on coach leaving at 4:25pm back from Leeds to London Victoria yesterday - there was also a hold up in Sheffield for approx 30-30 minutes- then we had to get off at Ruby and change onto another coach- with only 15-20 announcement prior to arriving in Rugby and no reason given for this - arriving in London Victoria at 21:50 hours instead of 20:40 hours,29 October 2023

My experience with your service is…My experience with your service is extremely poor and frustrating with your cs team not having the interest of the customer. My ticket was never used cause of delay from your service and I requested a refund or a voucher ticket of same value for another trip which is the least a company can offer as compensation for poor experience but unfortunately the opposite is the case. I've had similar delay and experience with national express but my ticket was refunded which is why I would chose that service over your poor annoying service.

"Cardiff to LondonRecently booked a return trip from Cardiff to London with a friend to see a gig. The price was fantastic, probably only paid third of one way train ticket for the for the both of us!!The coach was very comfortable but there were a few issues. The departure time was changed and although I was contacted by email rebooking was very confusing and I had to call the office for assistance. The person I spoke to was helpful but also agreed that re-booking is not straightforward. On the day of departure the bus was 30 minutes late and it would have been helpful to have been kept updated by text. The driver didn’t offer an explanation or an apology which I felt would have been courteous. I was also disappointed that there was no WiFi and the toilet left a lot to be desired. No toilet paper, hand towels, sanitiser, a loose seat and it was quite smelly. After my first visit I stopped drinking my juice and held on until Victoria 😬 Overall however I feel the Megbus is great value for money and would travel with them again.",28 October 2023

"Think twice before booking with Megabus or CitylinkBooked a Megabus from Inverness to Aberdeen for the 2nd time (after one bad experience) and it seems that I haven't learned my lesson.When I arrived at the platform to get the last bus of the day, the personnel told me that my bus was cancelled due to bad weather and all buses the next day were oversold. I didn't get one single notification/email regarding this cancellation. Needless to say you can't find details regarding statuses on these buses anywhere.Had I received this information in advance, I would have booked somewhere else immediately but Megabus doesn't seem to be up to date with any of these features.I also could have cancelled my accommodation which I also lost in Edinburgh. Needless to say that the customer service that is only available by email and useless. They asked me several questions, doubting my query, regarding that cancelled bus before they could reimburse me. Due to having a tight schedule, I had to book the earliest train to Edinburgh to get my flight as Megabus didn't offer early departures and all buses were full. Do you think they wanted to compensate me for this?My first bad experience was last year when I had no idea that Megabus and Citylink were working together. I was unfortunate to miss my bus due to a rude bus driver who worked for Citylink replying that they are NOT Megabus which resulted in me missing this bus and waited for Megabus that never came. It must have been their political wars when Megabus bought out Citylink or something. Well whatever, I'm over these companies once and for all!Bottomline, I learned from these experiences that Megabus or Citylink don't like taking responsibility whatsoever. They won't compensate you for any reason and are very short in their emails. They claim that in their terms & conditions they have to right to cancel your booking without any responsibility with or without a notice. They claim they offer “Flexible tickets in case your plans change”, “Track your coach”, “Free WI-FI”, and “Onboard charging point” but none of these things were available. Well I think everyone should take this as a warning. Thanks Megabus and Citylink for making me a wiser person and never to trust bus companies easily!NOTE: They always say they will look into and investigate but they do NOTHING. Please stop lying Megabus!",20 October 2023

They collect the white passengers's bags and put in the cargo bay area without any checks and just let them go in the bus to sit down. This will be my last time ever to patronise them.

"Late departure, late arrival and out of use toiletThe bus arrived 20 minutes before it was due to depart but the driver had to take a 45 minute break before setting off from Bristol to Norwich so it was 20 minutes late leaving Bristol. As we boarded the bus the inspector announced that the toilet on board was blocked so would be out of use for the journey. Most people were doing shorter journeys but I was going to Norwich, a 7 hour journey. I complained to the inspector and was told nothing could be done but the driver eventually told me that I could hop off quickly to use public toilets at Oxford Bus Station when the bus stopped there.At Birmingham there was a change of drivers. The new driver heroically set about unblocking the toilet before setting off so another delay but he had to unblock it again a couple of stops later so it was out of use for most of the trip.The bus arrived late at Norwich by which time I’d been on it for 8 and a half hours with only one toilet stop and no other chance to get off the bus.The drivers were absolutely brilliant but the schedule is punishing so I won’t be using megabus for a long journey ever again as this experience was awful and very unsettling.",09 October 2023

"Lost luggage with MegabusI boarded a Megabus coach from Birmingham to Huddersfield on the 30th of September , 2023. On embarking from the bus in Huddersfield I forgot my backpack on the luggage hold of the bus. I immediately called the customer care representative pleading with them to ask the driver to keep my bag at the next stop. I was told to report my missing bag at MissingX and the bag would be located.But up till now, my bag has not being located, the customer care has been really insensitive to my plight even me telling them that there are important documents in my bag which I needed urgently for my job. This has been by far the worst experience I have had on any coach service in my entire period of travelling. The fact that they lost property office do not even reply to your emails and queries is really annoying.",30 September 2023

"Rude and inconsiderate driver.The bus driver was quite rude and unhelpful. When I enquired if his bus was the one we needed he barely glanced at our tickets so I enquired if he was going to Leeds to which he grumpily replied yes and then mumbled incoherently about seating. He stood at the front of the bus and refused to help anyone put their luggage on the bus. As we were boarding another customer tried to ask him a question to which he interrupted the gentleman and frustratingly told him to sit in the seats towards the back, when the man tried to ask his question again the driver just shooed him away with his hand and said ""seats near the back"".Our seats were at the front of the coach so we had clear view of his very inconsiderate driving where he forced his way into tight spots at a roundabout almost clipping the front of a car who had right of way. Whilst driving at one point due to traffic build up he used his phone to look for traffic updates and re-routes which caused him to veer into the other lane. He regularly drove too close to the back of cars in front of him, swapped lane at short notice of other drivers, did not always follow the speed limit and even at one point called a driver of a car a ""stupid b*@ch"". I did not feel safe at any point on my journey and was relieved to reach my destination. This is not the usual quality of driver I have had previously or expect from Megabus.",22 September 2023

They then emailed all of the passengers to send them our contact info so they could arrange taxis to take us to Southampton where we would meet up with the coach. I was the first to provide my number. Eventually I was sent a text message that said a 16 seater had been booked. Instead, a 5 seater Skoda arrived. Unaware that any other passengers were expected to join me in this taxi, I got in on my own and made it to Southampton. It turned out, they had booked a series of taxis in my name expecting me to pass on all the information to the other passengers, who I had no way of contacting. Eventually the other passengers did end up arriving to the coach but the entire situation was communicated very poorly.",13 October 2023
"Cancelled service, no communication, only partial refundWe were waiting for our Megabus to the airport, which was delayed, according to the noticeboard at Stirling station, by 30 min. There was no update on the Megabus tracker. We even spoke to one of their drivers locally who did not know anything about the bus's whereabouts, and just referred us to the noticeboard. After the 30 min had passed, the service simply disappeared from the noticeboard, suggesting it was cancelled.Megabus told us later that it was cancelled due to bad weather and that they do not communicate with the bus station, whose noticeboards, although displaying info on Megabus Services, apparently do not have any info on Megabus Services. So they displayed misleading info. By waiting around for a bus that was announced late but that never came, we almost had to cancel our whole trip abroad. Luckily we managed to rush home and took my (not much used) car spontaneously (and dangerously, as it had a flattish tyre, as we only noticed on arrival). It got us there by the skin of our teeth.Everyone else managed to find a way around the bad weather and blocked junction, but Megabus said later that they had not wanted to miss any stops so could not take the slight diversion, hence the cancellation (but did not bother telling anybody). It's better to cancel a bus and leave 60 people stranded in Stirling, than to miss one or two along the way, it seems.Customer services only paid me a refund after I wrote several emails (and this review). They won't reimburse me for extra costs incurred due to parking etc either, even though it is their fault that I had to take the car instead of the bus.I understand that the weather sometimes gets in the way, but there is absolutely no excuse for putting up false information and not communicating when a service is delayed or cancelled.",12 October 2023

"Awful experience with MegabusI booked the 22:30 train from Newcastle to Manchester Airport at 22:30 on 4th October. The train was due to get in at 3:55 am, which was nearly three hours before our flight (giving us plenty of time).When we arrived, the bus driver of another bus informed us that the bus was extremely delayed and would not be arriving until at least 23:45 at which stage the driver would need to take a mandatory 45-minute break before departure. He very clearly told us that the bus would not be departing before 00:30, two hours after it was due to depart. This would have left us arriving at the airport with less than an hour before our flight which was not feasible as we had bags to check in and were flying to a family wedding.I tried to get in contact with Megabus at that point to no avail and so we had no option but to book an Uber to Manchester airport. This is a three hour journey and cost nearly £300.Megabus have refused to give to us any refund whatsoever. They won't even refund us the price of the fare. The bus ended up arriving 93 minutes late and they claim that the refunds are only issued when the bus is 120 minutes. This is absolutely absurd and completely unfair, especially in circumstances where we were told by a Megabus employee that the bus would be at least 2 hours late. I will never travel with Megabus again and have found their customer service to be appalling.",04 October 2023
One star service from Mega busMy wife and I boarded a 12.30 bus to Sheffield and I had paid for two reserved seats. However the driver came and demanded that we vacate these seats as we have paid for the reservation seats for the return leg of the journey. He embarrassed us in front of the whole bus. The fact of the matter was that it clearly stated that our reserved seats were from London to Sheffield. Then bus had a flat tyre and we were stranded on the services after an hour wait we were moved to another bus. During this move I forgot my book and and water bottle in previous bus. On the return journey the driver refused to allow us on the reserved seat seats stating that it was not him who refused us the reserved seats.,02 October 2023

He allowed a great deal of young people on the bus , when there wasn't enough seating , they were all drinking alcohol, playing very very loud music,  sitting on the floor of the bus , and taking drugs ,which was witnessed by my daughters . Megabus customer service were notified of this , but did nothing . Lancaster police were informed but did nothing . By sheer good luck they got to Manchester in one piece . They felt so unsafe they did not travel back with megabus the following day , they paid for a train to get them home . Completely and utterly unacceptable",07 October 2023

"The bus was an hour & a half late for…The bus was an hour & a half late for my journey to Leeds. I was unable to track it after a while as it just said tracking unavailable. I requested a chat with a bot. I just got repeatedly told that I could track my bus to see where it was; this unfortunately was not the case as tracking was unavailable. I waited in a queue for st least 10 minutes to answer my question but just remained at number 2 in the queue. Eventually, I managed to find a phone number to ring. Just as the customer service person was trying to track my bus, it arrived. I heard someone on the bus say that there had been an oil leak & that was the reason for the delay. No explanation was given to those people getting on at Leicester for the delay. The return bus journey started off well. The bus arrived on time and the driver explained that there was a delay as the driver taking over from him was delayed on the motorway. He allowed us to board the bus which was good. This driver also reminded me that I had reserved a seat. Someone was in my seat but they moved when I told them I'd reserved that seat. The bus made the two scheduled stops at Meadowhall & Tibshelf. It then made another stop at Leicester Forest East, which I was told by another passenger was 'often done' to allow some people to go to the shop or the toilet. This stop was not on the schedule & confused people unfamiliar with the route; a young man behind me assumed we must be at Leicester Fosse Park, our final destination, so I had to explain this to him. Some 'discussion' ensued downstairs as people were taking too long off the bus. The driver said 'if you let one person off the bus, then they all want to go'. No one should have been allowed off the bus. I personally would have liked a toilet break but I would not have dreamt of asking for one as this was not given as an option on Megabus. As we started to leave Leicester Forest East, I heard someone on the bus  say that someone was left behind in the shop.  The driver said that it was too bad, as he had to go & he drove off, assumably leaving that person behind.  I may not have remembered the last conversation in sequence but I am giving these details to the best of my recollection, so as to be helpful to Megabus. I did research my outward journey to Leeds by going to the bus stop two days prior to my journey. That Megabus was also at least half an hour late - I didn't wait to see how late it was.  I do not give negative reviews lightly and I certainly won't be recommending Megabus to anyone based on my experience.",06 October 2023

This was the M20 bus from Edinburgh to Newcastle on Sunday 1st October at 11.05am. He told us that we would need to ask for a refund. Also our bus on the return journey back to Edinburgh was 50 mins late and we missed our connecting Megabus bus back to Dundee.,01 October 2023

Coach departed on time but lost 10 minutes due to roadworks on M4 (not a major issue) but then lost another 10 minutes as the driver did not seem to know how to get out of Reading. Google Maps saved the day! The 20 minute delay into Heathrow meant that my onward journey became a major panic.

On the 2nd of October, 2023, I was to travel by midnight bus from Newcastle to London. The bus didn't arrive on time and the staff I met at the pick up point were rude and didn't offer an explanation to me and the other waiting for the bus nor did they even try to sympathize with us.Eventually, the bus came and on our way to london, the bus broke down at Luton and the bus driver told us that it will take 2 and half hour for the replacement bus to come to our location. I had to pay for uber to take me to the nearest train station where I bought a train ticket to London.I nearly missed my appointment in London and also had to pay extra for the Uber and Train ticket. It was my first experience and I deeply regretted using Megabus. To the best of my knowledge, I think that National Express is much better than Megabus and I hope Megabus improves its services going forward.Regards,Emeka.",02 October 2023

I boarded the bus to find it smelled of urine. I took my seat at the front, which I had reserved, to discover that the panel under the front window was broken and missing screws so it rattled the entire journey and looked like it was about to fall off. I then discovered there was no WiFi on board so I couldn't do the things on the Internet that I was planning too. The bus was also almost half an hour late arriving at Manchester Airport.

And also on our way back to London,night journey (22:15 / 29th Friday)I hope management will look on this matter.Apart from that,on behalf of my family,we're always happy and use Mega Bus for our travels.Thank you so much Mega bus❤️👍⭐️🙏",26 September 2023

"Terrible service. A reserved seat is reserved for those that pay for it. At least have the decency to answer the phone to deal with the refund.We tried booking with PayPal pay in 3, a given option in the booking payment options, and Megabus kept the order for the tickets pending until 12hrs before travel. Then approx 12hrs before travel Megabus denied the booking. So we rebooked the tickets over  again, and another MAJOR issue which had arisen the previous time we tried booking happened again, that the system only allowed us to continue with the booking if we paid for reserved seats, having no choice we had to pay for the reserved seats. Then when we got on the bus and went to our reserved seats some rude woman was sitting in our seats. She told us she paid for her seat on our seats with no proof of it. Clearly a lie. We showed her our booking reservation which had our seat numbers, but she wouldn't budge.We went down to the staff downstairs on the bus no wanting to cause a fight, and he said ""It's a full bus so everyone can sit wherever."" We explained that we paid for seat reservations, the Megabus staff member said ""you'll have to claim back from Megabus for the reservations."" So we sat down elsewhere for the rest of the duration of the journey. When we arrived we called up Megabus only to be held on the phone for ages with an automated message, but nobody picked up the phone to deal with our refunds for the seat reservations which we paid for but were apparently non-existent. Terrible service!!!",26 September 2023

"Never Again 👎Would never book mega bus ever again. I’ve done the coach journey to London many times with other companies and each time has been brilliant. 5/6 hours to get there with a few service stops along the way. Easy. Not with mega bus it’s not. Despite my high hopes, it was the worse coach journey I’ve ever been on. We boarded the coach at 6am. No where was open to get any drinks or snacks so we planned on getting something to eat at a rest stop. The coach journey took nearly 9 hours to get to London and didn’t stop once along the way. This meant me and my partner had to sit on a coach for 9 hours with no water, no food and no way to stretch our legs. We arrived in London 1hr and 45 mins late which derailed our plans for the evening and we nearly missed a show we came to see. The coach journey home was equally as awful as we arrived home nearly 2 hours later than we were supposed to and again, another 9 hour coach journey with no rest breaks. Never again.",23 September 2023

"I travel Aberdeen to PrestonI travel Aberdeen to Preston, and return, every few months to see family, so am familiar with the journey.The bus is usually 1/2hr late arriving in Preston ( to Glasgow) and this doesn’t bother me so long as I can catch my connecting bus to Aberdeen.In this instance though I missed the first, and then second connecting busses. The second bus was leaving the stance in Buchanan st. just as I was getting my bag from the first. If that bus had waited just 2 more mins I’d have been on it. In the past I’ve seen drivers waiting .. not on this instance sadly! I was pretty annoyed.I find the mega bus great for my needs and the price is brilliant.The drivers are always good. I’m not a fussy passenger but the above incident added 2 hrs onto a journey of already 8hours or so.Can I ask a question too ?Why doesn’t the Preston to Lancaster leg of the journey go up the motorway ? That snaking through all the little roads up to Lancaster seems a bit stupid to me.Anyway Thankyou for a mostly very good service 👍",29 September 2023

"Megabus is a joke, they ripping people offI really don’t know who runs this company with this mess. I bought my ticket from London Victoria to Liverpool today. And it was connect journey which means I have to get off in Leeds and jump in another Bus to Liverpool.The bus was supposed to leave at 8:00am sharp but he didn’t come until 9:45am and in top of that driver decided to take 45 minutes break. Because the delay in London that mean I will not be able to catch the other bus from Leeds to Liverpool which also means I will not be able to come back same day as I planned with another coach company which already was booked beforehand and I had to cancel.I requested a refund and apology but same message I keep receiving from the Enquiries team that any delay that is 120 minutes or above is entitled to refund and my delay was only 105 minutes so I am not entitled to a refund.So the company must do delay but in their policy it must be 120 minutes or above to be entitled to refund which is a ridiculous condition and a joke.They jeopardize people plans and times and on top of that take our money for no service provided whatsoever.I got a reply from the company with same repeated messages that they are sorry for the delay blah blah blah and they cannot refund the money. Well the money is the least they can return but the fact that they have the guts to keep arguing about this 120 minutes is what driving me mad so if the bus delay was 118 or 119 minutes no refund. And when it comes towards refunding people money they must be precise about timing but they entitled to keep delaying people below the 120 minutes and jeopardize people plans so no one could ask about refunding. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT SERVICE HAVE THEY PROVIDED TOWARDS THIS MONEY THEY TOOK FROM ME OR ANYONE ELSE IN SAME SITUATION. It’s very good business anyone can open a company like this and make his own policy and keep delaying people below the 120 minutes and end of the month making millions without spending on petrol or driver salary  or providing any service etc etc. just money machine.",05 October 2023

"Bus never arrivedAttempted to travel from Paris to London through this company. Arrived 15 minutes before the departure to find that the bus was already full and would not accept any more passengers (I had purchased a ticket in advance). As a result, me and about 10 other unfortunate travelers were left stranded. The driver stated that another bus would come to pick us up in 5 minutes but this never happened and was clearly said just to silence us and allow him to drive away. After countless attempts to contact megabus, the phone number provided with tickets and on their website would not yield any answer whatsoever. After about an hour I lost hope and ended up paying 100£for a flixbus to my destination. I am in the process of demanding a refund and do not recommend this awful experience to anyone.

Hi I've traveled 8 return journeys to…Hi I've traveled 8 return journeys to and from London to Glasgow and I've never had any problems with the drivers etc but megabus really need to sort out the toilets on the coaches I only can sit down stairs as I have COPD (breathing difficulties) and from the minute I get on the toilets stink so it's not like they have been used so they are obviously not being cjCLeaned so that's why it's only 3stars but can fault it any other way,25 September 2023

"NEVER use MegabusI was waiting the bus for nearly one hour by myself with my baby waiting to go to the airport and catch a flight, but I tried to check where the bus was on live to see if was to much tome to wait or if was close and the system was saying that could not fine the bus, then I tried to phone megabus and no answer for a while, at the end as nobody told me when the bus will arrive, I called my husband, he left his job and came to pick me up to drive me to the airport.In our way to the airport I keep trying speak with someone from megabus bus was a long wait, when finally I reach someone they told me that it was a problem in the system and they can not say where that bus it was, but that they are not giving the money back because the bus was lousy delay and not cancel. I am really upset but something sure I NEVER will travel with Megabus and I will I for everyone around me to avoid as much they can because it is not a serious company.",22 September 2023

"Tiring, stressful disappointing trip to LondonHaving arrived early for my 01:55 bus, it was delayed by over 100+ minutes. Over that period of waiting, two FlixBuses (going to the same) destination have been and gone. It should have arrived in London Victoria by 06:40 (I had a 9am meeting), but the delay meant that the bus got stuck in Central London rush hour traffic. The driver kindly let me get off early at Edgeware Road Tube stop just before 9am (since I had no luggage) and I took the underground from there for the rest of my journey. Despite all that, I still ended up 30 minutes late for my 9am meeting. I am making the same journey down to London again following week and this time I have decided to give Flixbus a go to see how that compares.",27 September 2023
The change in timetable from…The change in timetable from Loughborough to drop the earlier service 715 I think and instead put in a 930 service was bad enough but that now stops at Rugby and Northampton which on the day I used it picked no one up at those stops. Sorry but this makes a day return to london incredibly difficult so will be switching to national express,24 September 2023

"My mega bus 3 star reviewI'm rating megabus a 3 star because my journey to London from Glasgow wasn't as I expected. My overall journey was from Aberdeen to London.The bus that carried us from Glasgow to London didn't even have charging pods. It was quite forgettable. My phones battery was dead and I was disappointed I couldn't charge on the bus. Mega bus should please ensure all intercity buses should be equipped with charging pods. Nevertheless, my booking experience was easy and straightforward. The drivers were friendly and professional.",24 September 2023

"My bus M11 to Birmingham via Glasgow…My bus M11 to Birmingham via Glasgow was scheduled to depart at 8:00am on 27th of sept 2023.However, due to the alleged vehicle breakdown the bus never surfaced until when I took a random decision at 10:00am to join another bus which was plying through Birmingham but with a longer travel time .Apparently ,I had an interview to catch up with at Wolverhampton at 14:00 and due to all these challenges, I eventually arrived in Birmingham at 14:10hrs before I could get to Wolverhampton it was already past 15:00hrs.On this note, even if MEGABUS decided to refund me for my ticket, the damages it has caused me can never be matched with the refund.Meanwhile this is about the third time in a row I have experienced similar disappointments with no signs of service improvements from MEGABUS.I made bold to say that I have had no value for my money with MEGABUS so far and I am utterly disappointed.I believe you guys can do better.",27 September 2023
"Disappointed with delayThe reason i give a 3 star rating is because the mega bus was delayed by over 2 hours I had book in plenty of time to get to Middlesbrough hospital well before 21.00. The mega bus that was delayed would have got me to Middlesbrough for 7-25 leaving me plenty of time to get the the hospital and spend time with my uncle in hospital who was critically ill, I did not get there until after 9-30 and the nurses could not let me in. However once i was on the coach the journey there was nice and comfortable the coach was nice and clean .",22 September 2023

Once we sat on our told seats he then announced that the some of the usb ports are not working and there is no heating as well on the lower deck where we were seated.

This was fine for perhaps 20-30 mins but after a couple of hours got a bit jarring.For the leg from Birmingham to Nottingham, which was to arrive at 15.30, we had been informed that they were dropping off Nottingham passengers at the Trent University stop due to the Robin Hood Half Marathon. The half marathon though finished at 12.30 and all the NCT buses were running a standard Sunday service from 13.30 - so I do not understand the reason or inconvenience of being dropped off outside the city and then having to pay additional public transport to get to the centre.",24 September 2023

"UnfortunatelyUnfortunately, on the way there, I received several atrocities from a Ukrainian man with an unassuming appearance, which I reported to the bus driver, who wanted to call the police. The camera shows that a man and I were sitting in seat 5 with a window. The Ukrainian sends the man that he wants to sit there with his family (3 people). The man sat somewhere else, I didn't. At that time, even though there were 4 empty seats, he sat quietly on my breast and pressed his body. That hurt, so I got out and sat down. One more. During the night, his wife talked till the end. I said back that it was night, quieter. Then he got up and hit him on the head. I immediately ran to complain to the bus driver, who came up, turned on the light, asked what had happened, and indicated that it was a criminal act. I also traveled together with this family. By then the man was limping. Maybe he was involved in something else on the street. The bus driver placed them downstairs, the passengers were upstairs, only them downstairs in seats 4-4, and 2 people at the toilet. The bus was 1 hour and 10 minutes late in the morning because of them.",25 September 2023

I am writing today to complain of the…I am writing today to complain of the poor service me and my partner received from your company on the 23rd September 2023.I am truly disappointed in the service the mega bus offered us. We had booked the bus in months of advance Traveling from Sheffield to London in the morning and getting picked up at 12am at night to return to Sheffield with chosen seats and paid extra for front seats with more leg room Due to me suffering with sciatica.We arrived at Victoria bus station waiting to get onto our bus in the que for the bus to arrive due to it being late! The bus driver let on at least 4 people that had missed their bus and offered to take them! Then to be told by the driver that the seats we had booked were not available on the bus due to being a different bus!!me and my partner was split up for a 6 hour journey sat next to strangers! I needed to sleep due to being self employed and having to work that morning! There was no possible way I could sleep with a lady next to me taking all my leg room and on her phone the whole time! Not only that but the bus driver was running nearly a hour behind having to stop for more fuel and clearly the bus wasn’t prepared for the long journey!! People were getting on with little children that had booked seats also and they was told they had to be separated a 2 year old girl and a young mother is disgusting!! No one would move to let them sit together until she kicked up a massive fuss!Overall this company is a complete shambles and really needs organising better!!,23 September 2023

"Daniel is a fantastic memeber of staff!!I was travelling in the afternoon of 23/09/2023 from Victoria Coach Station to Bournemouth after a long morning flight and I was in a pickle with transport. Daniel (he was in the megabus customer service office) was extremally professional and kind, helped me get on the right coach and answered my questions. I appreciate it greatly, especially that I was exhausted from the trip and really needed guidance! Exceptional communication skills and knowledge! Could not imagine better customer service, thank you so much!!!!",23 September 2023
"Dissimulation, significant disruptions, and lack of transparencyReview summary:My experience with Megabus on a journey from Leeds to Manchester Airport was marked by significant disruptions and a lack of transparency. Despite arriving early and witnessing other passengers on board, the bus did not depart as scheduled, leading to the risk of missing a flight. Forced to arrange a costly taxi, I sought reimbursement from Megabus, but their responses contradicted my experience and failed to provide concrete evidence. Their staff provided inaccurate information, adding to the frustration. Megabus's unwillingness to address legitimate concerns and provide transparency has left me seeking redress through other channels.Review:My customer experience with Megabus was horrendous and I feel compelled to share for the benefit of future customers. This ordeal began when I booked a journey from Leeds to Manchester Airport in April, and it unfolded as a frustrating saga of disruptions, a lack of transparency, and evasive customer service.My relatives (who were visiting and were going to the airport) and I arrived at Lane 1 of the Leeds bus station well ahead of schedule, at least 15 minutes before the planned departure time of 14:10. We observed approximately 20 other passengers on board the bus at that time. However, to our dismay, the bus did not depart as scheduled. The operators claimed the bus had already departed from somewhere else and was already halfway through its journey. The operators told all customers that the bus was now coming back to pick them up from Leeds.The situation became dire as we realized we were at risk of missing our flight. Left with no other option, we were compelled to arrange for a taxi, incurring a substantial expense that would have been entirely avoidable if the bus had operated as promised. It's important to note that our decision to take a taxi was guided by the information provided to us by Megabus coordinators on the scene, who suggested that we take the taxi and later claim reimbursement for the expense.To support our case, I provided Megabus with compelling evidence in the form of photographic timestamps. These photographs clearly depicted passengers waiting next to the bus and engaging with Megabus coordinators. This evidence directly contradicted the statements made by Megabus's private operator, Prospect Coaches, and their subsequent emails, all of which maintained that the service departed on time. The photographic evidence irrefutably demonstrated that the bus remained stationed at Stand 1 well after the scheduled departure time, calling into question the accuracy of Megabus's claims.Adding to the frustration, my ticket for this journey clearly indicated that the service was operated by Megabus, with no mention of Prospect Coaches. This raises serious concerns about the transparency and reliability of information provided to passengers by Megabus staff. One would expect accuracy and dependability when dealing with a popular service provider, yet this experience demonstrated a significant shortfall in this regard. I can only imagine there was a lack of communication between Megabus and Prospect Coaches that lead to this situation. When contacted, Prospect Coaches did not answer.Regrettably, the lack of transparency persisted in my interactions with Megabus's customer service. Their responses not only failed to address my legitimate concerns but also appeared to deflect responsibility and accountability. Megabus consistently avoided providing concrete evidence, including specific details such as the vehicle identification number, driver details, and any available tracking information that adhered to GDPR anonymization processes. This refusal to provide clear answers heightened my frustration and raised suspicions about the validity of their claims.Despite multiple attempts to seek resolution and accountability, Megabus has repeatedly failed to provide the requested information and transparent responses. This has left me with no choice but to pursue further action with Bus Users UK.In conclusion, my experience with Megabus on this journey was marred by a lack of transparency, contradictory information, and a refusal to address legitimate concerns. It is my hope that future customers can make informed decisions when choosing their travel options and be aware of the potential pitfalls they may encounter when dealing with Megabus.",16 April 2023

"Abandoned in Swansea.I decided to use megabus for a round trip to Swansea from London Victoria because it was the cheapest option.I decided to pay the premium for a seat that had very little leg room and a loose panel that rattled the whole journey.I tried to use the bathroom but, as I am 6 foot 4, I could barely fit.Then, on the return journey, the driver left 17 minutes early (instead of 23:40) so I missed it and was unable to contact anyone from megabus so I was ABANDONED in Swansea with absolutely NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.Luckily I was able to book with another provider.This was a desperately bad service and I will NEVER use megabus again.",22 September 2023
"TRAIN YOUR OLD MEN DRIVERS MANNERSThis company should fire all of their old men drivers or at least train them to be nice humans because they are some sort of a joke!!!!!! They are always rude for no godamn reason. The other day I was going on a megabus from Dundee to Perth bus station (M8), we were traveling with instruments as we were going to college to study music, it is never a problem to bring our guitars on and out them in the above head cabins but apparently this time it was a big deal. I was told to put my guitar in the big storage bit by a lady that worked at the bus station, I was confused and said to the old man driver ""can I not just put it in the over head cabin"" I wasn't being rude, I am just concerned for my guitar as it is expensive and means a lot to me. The driver then replied in a rude tone ""you've just been told to put it in the storage bit so do it"" I was mad but I had to do it because I had no other way to get to Perth, I managed to get over it by the time we got to Perth until ,this godamn driver decided to take the guitars out himself instead of letting us do it, and doing so he banged one of my friends bass rather hard off the bus by accident, NOT EVEN A SORRY OUT OF THIS MANS MOUTH!! He is lucky the bass was fine, but seriously do these grown men not get taught manners in their life. Every single time the driver is a young woman they are always lovely and make my journey better, if all of them were like that I would give 5 stars but these grown ass men ruin it. I have had problems about my guitar being on board with other old men drivers but I managed to get the guitar on with a bit of an argument, never has it been a pro lem when the driver was a young woman. RETRAIN YOUR DRIVERS MEGABUS!!!!!",21 September 2023
"Horrible Company.I’m being pretty nice giving this 1 star, this company (All the old men drivers for this company) deserve -10 stars. Mega bus train your older men better. I was getting a bus with my friends and we all had our musical instruments (guitars and basses) which are worth more than your company. and the (Old Man) driver shouted at my friend to put out EXPENSIVE equipment into the bottom of the bus. We have never had to do this before since we put it above the seats on the storage or in between our legs. If our expensive gear broke YOU would be responsible. ALSO this driver decided to take out equipment out the storage area for us (which we didn’t want because it’s expensive) and this man hit the top of my bass off the bus really hard. I am not happy. The way this man spoke to my friend was absolutely unneeded. Your customers deserve to be respected and this isn’t the case. We get the bus to and from college every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday and 90% of the time the bus drivers are horrible to us just because we’re 16-18 years old who have talent and can afford expensive equipment. The only drivers who are nice to us are Young Men and Woman. We have been shouted at a week ago to put our expensive equipment into the bottom of the bus but we refused to because we don’t want our expensive equipment to break because most of us can’t afford to repair or replace our equipment which we call our children. “You’re just going to take up a whole seat for your instrument if you bring it on board” NO we don’t there’s over head storage for a reason and if not we put it in between our legs. Our instrument isn’t any different than somebody bringing their loud and dirty child on the bus.",21 September 2023

"megatravels on megabusI had a quick day trip from London to Newcastle on 11 September 2023.It was the 1355 from London Finchley Road, returning on the 2250.There had been a vehicle change in London, so it was a private operator vehicle that was used on this occasion.It is a company that regularly supplies vehicles for megabus services, although the drivers are employed by Stagecoach.I had a comfortable journey to Newcastle, arriving a little late. I think that some of the timings are a little on the ‘tight’ side.The same coach operated the service back to London. Again, the service was slightly late but this was due to the A1(M) being closed in places.Unfortunately, the coach did not have wi-fi or USB sockets, but this did not cause me any problems.I have ample data available and I always take a power bank with me.I have travelled thousands of miles on megabus. In fact I have used their services since they started twenty years ago. I remember with great fondness my £1.00 journeys on the old Hong Kong Leyland double deckers with Alexander bodywork. Things then progressed to Volvo B10M ‘expressliner’ coaches that had come off National Express. The Neoplan Skyliner double deck vehicles, Plaxton Paragon, Van Hool Altanos through to the occasional Levante and the Plaxton Interdeck vehicles.I remember with even more affection my £1.00 journeys from London to Paris, Paris to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to London.I only wish that I had sampled the Barcelona and Cologne services.I am an extremely satisfied megabus user. Yes, things sometimes do go wrong, but on the whole megabus is comfortable and reliable.Long may it continue!!!!!!!!",10 September 2023

Later on,  he stopped on the hard shoulder of the M3 very close to the entrance of Fleet services so he could use the coach toilet. Why not just drive into the services and stop? So much safer. Later in the journey he stopped at Rownams services (M27) to kill some time. We were running ahead of schedule. After leaving Rownams he again stopped on the hard shoulder worried that he had left some passengers behind (he hadn’t). I wondered what he would have done? Reversed up the hard shoulder back to the services?",07 September 2023

"Absolutely worst transport service.Absolutely worst transport service.Address of station was just name of the street, we found out that we need to wait at regular bus stop. At 00:25 was the ticket, no bus arrived, no update and no customer service available at that time. Completely darkness in industrial area. I was with 4 years old kid. No live bus was on website.We was a bit in rush to not get late to airport and took taxi what cost us more than plane ticket. At the end they don’t want to do at least refund as they replied that in terms mentioning that bus can be late more than 100 minutes. And gave me advice to take train next time.Horrible service!",27 August 2023
"Bus tracking needs to be improvedBus tracking needs to be improved.  Travelling home from Gatwick late Sunday night - bus was 50minutes late.  Tracking page was unable to provide an update for the bus, phones closed at 6pm and no rep at airport - so no way to find out if it was still coming or to try and secure  a space on the last bus with another company.  Another passenger had also been waiting same time for a bus to another destination, but my driver could not update for other bus.  Megabus is a bit cheaper, but if travelling out of hours, it’s probably a better option to pay a bit more and go with national express where there is a help desk and update screen at airport.",17 September 2023

Some had had a drink already and I heard them say to the driver they were going to a party in Edinburgh. Once we left broxden copious amounts of alcohol were produced and the party proceeded to imbibe, getting louder and louder, singing shouting and swearing loudly. Even my headphones failed to drown out the noise, a spoilt trip to the capital.  In the company rules it says 'Alcoholic drinks are prohibited' why is this not enforced?",16 September 2023

"Dissatisfied with customer serviceOn 11 September I travelled from Canada to Birmingham Heathrow airport with my son, purchased a bus ticket for £36.10 reservation 38/39-4304-110923-M15N-1220-LHR-BIR. At the airport the signage for your bus service and where to go was nonexistent it took us some time to find the area to go to to catch the bus once we were there I noticed that there was a megabus driver in the loading dock area as a result I went up to him to ask him some questions and get some help as I was unfamiliar and unsure if we were in the right area to catch the 1220 MB from Heathrow to Birmingham Brunel Street, the bus driver was instantly rude, ignoring my questions and unhelpful, he was not concerned with regards to my questions once he learned that we weren’t catching his bus which was going to Oxford, he offered no help couldn’t be bothered to help me and walked away. After this unpleasant experience it continued with our next Megabus driver, this was our original booked bus 12:20pm from Heathrow to Birmingham Brunel St. Our bus driver allowed other passengers ahead of us to load numerous bags Per person, at one point he allowed someone to load six luggage bags, this practice of allowing passengers  to load extra bags continued with a number of other passengers that had obviously not paid for the extra bags from his reaction and conversation he was having with them. When he got to us he said that he had no more room in his luggage compartment for our bags and other passengers that were waiting with us as well. We asked him if he could re-organize the compartment as there appear to be more room inside the luggage compartment resulting in having room for our bags,he got very frustrated upset and rude at us and said he was not re-organizing the compartment and continued to shut the compartment door in front of our faces, as he walked away I said what do we do now we are not from here, we booked this a week ago and need to be in Birmingham by 3pm as we had booked appointments and reservations, he said as he walked into the bus you’ll have to get another bus I don’t have room. I asked him what about my refund or get another bus when does the next one come, he continued to be rude with us saying go to customer service and shut the door in our face. He then started to reverse the bus with us still by the bus door and almost ran over my sons foot, I yelled at him and as he was reversing he looked at me and gave me the finger, I took a picture of him and the bus as a result we complain to the airport employees in the bus loading area,  they advised us to go to the customer service desk to re-organize another bus. I went to the customer service desk,they advise that they were not able to refund our bus original bus ticket and any refund or complaints had to be dealt with the megabus company directly. I had to purchase another ticket which cost £42, t we were able to get another Mbus at 1:50 PM from Heathrow to Birmingham that our experience with megabus was terrible, I would expect this incident is concerning for you as well. I would like to be compensated for the original ticket that I purchased for £36.10 and refunded by to my credit card and further this unknown  bus driver  in question should be spoken to with regards to his conduct and being very unprofessional and unhelpful it was poor customer service.",10 September 2023

Took longer to load and probably slowed journey down.  Heard driver tell these passengers (rightly), think Megabus should be tougher with people who take liberties, wasn't just one extra small bag/case, lots literally had 1 or 2 extra cases. Should be clear they won't be allowed on at time of booking.But basically very happy with experience, above was only slight negative and not Megabus fault.",05 September 2023

A few of the passengers soon got rather worried about safety and couldn't properly relax throughout the journey, as it soon became very clear that the driver, was feeling tired at the wheel, not driving straight more often than not. He then started to tap on the steering wheel and whistled throughout the journey to keep himself awake.Also none of the USB ports were fitted or active, none of the overhead lights were working and the coach was rather warm.Glad that I got to London in one piece, albeit without any battery left on my mobile phone.Rather worrying that drivers are allowed behind the wheel when they clearly are not fit to drive...P.S:I also forgot to mention that the driver parked at the wrong stand point, so we almost missed the coach.

"In generalIn general, the service is fine, My main comments are:- replacing a bus sometimes at the last moment with another bus that doesn't have the options (like charging plugs, seats reserved) which might affect the passenger especially if he is travelling for long distances.- No rules announced (like wearing headphones, not taking off shoes -some people have a very bad feet smell-, talking loudly, and even sitting in a paid seat even if they don't have a booking for it -taking the benefits of being empty and cheating the bus driver after starting the journey and sit at the front-, these rules and changes should be announced and applied each time the driver is changed during the journey time.- When stopping at some stations, the driver doesn't announce for how long they are going to stay to give the passengers time to stretch their bodies, or buy something.- On my last journey, the USB socket was broken and I had to put my cable in the back seat to charge my phone, These things need to be checked properly before any journey.- The last comment, there should be standards for the passenger smell, some of them don't take care of their cleaning and go up on a journey with a very bad smell leaving others stuck with them for hours.",31 August 2023

I took a meghabus at 01:50 hours on 25th August from Heathrow to Reading, which was late. Then I took another return journey from Reading to London Victoria on 8th September.

He should wait until 10.46 to leave.",06 September 2023
"Buses need a good clean.The service itself ran smoothly and was on time at each stop and the price is very good. The downside is the seats on the buses were dirty and the aircon in some areas meant people were covering themselves up with jackets or stuffing the vents to stop the blast of cold air.  There is very little legroom for adults and if someone reclines their seat in front of you, you could be jammed in.  The drivers were very pleasant and helpful but the buses leave a lot to be desired.Thank you for your speedy and polite response.  It is much appreciated. 👍🏻",08 September 2023

"An Utter Travesty in Bus Travel!Having spent my life journeying across Brazil on buses and traveling through over 20 countries, including destinations in Southeast Asia, I've had my fair share of experiences. Yet, my recent trip with Megabus in the UK stands out - for all the wrong reasons!Our bus from Gatwick at 3 am was a frustrating 25 minutes late with no apology. As we journeyed to Victoria Station, the driver took a wrong turn, leading us towards a bridge the bus clearly couldn't navigate. The potential danger of this oversight is horrifying. He had to turn around and seemed completely lost!  By the end, we were delayed by a staggering 1.5 hours.When I contacted Megabus regarding the delay, they casually dismissed my concerns, stating they don't issue refunds for delays under 120 minutes. This blatant disregard for punctuality—a fundamental expectation for any transportation service—speaks volumes about their commitment to customer satisfaction. Their indifference to genuine issues is both shocking and inexcusable.Avoid Megabus at all costs!",09 September 2023

"It was almost a 4 out of 5It was almost a 4 out of 5, but one great feature saved the review.I was always reserved about using megabus in the past as I considered a competitive company the best at what they do.So, what makes megabus worthy of your travel journey? The ability to purchase tickets in advance is always a plus, to prebook your seat works flawlessly. Multiple charging points that include AC as well as usb (the other company only has AC and they are barely working these days)The original 4/5 score was pending as the bus turned up late, however as there was a link on the email/site itself to track the bud that (wasn’t) broken, I was able to see that the bus was just delayed and not cancelled.At this point I am more inclined to check Megabus now when I’m planning my journeys as even thought their prices are competitive, the plus sides outweigh me checking other companies first.Well done megabus. Keep climbing the progress bar and listening to feedback and I’ve no doubt your fleet will increase.",24 August 2023

"Shocking experienceShocking experience, as someone who doesn’t have experience getting buses I accidentally booked my return for the same day very close to the time I was leaving my city to go to Glasgow. (so can see it was a genuine mistake) anyway I went to get my bus after a busy day at a work course in Glasgow to be told I’d booked the previous day but the driver I spoke to was actually great and said don’t worry you can get the other bus as his was now full… fast forward I waited a few hours for said bus only to get on and be told I couldn’t use the ticket (the bus empty, quite literally) and the bus driver made me pay a whole new return (£30 again!) so I paid £60 total for one way for an hours journey home from Glasgow. That is a joke! I took the bus thinking it would be easier and cheaper and I paid £60 just to get home! I emailed megabus to explain and you can see from my booking it was a genuine mistake from someone who isn’t used to buses. And their customer service is was shocking! The train is much better and cheaper. Unreal amount of money for a bus home. Will never use them again and will be making sure my friends and family don’t too. Shear greed. Editing to add I’ve already emailed the address below and received shocking customer service as I stated above.",05 September 2023

Luckily my cousin was around Heathrow, he quickly helped us to inform the flight attendants of our situation, They were kind enough to wait extra minutes and were lucky I got in. I was the last to board. Would have missed the flight if we were 5 more minutes late. I had to take Uber which cost me £174 yet MegaBus cannot take any responsibility for all these inconveniences caused. I called customer service whilst we were being delayed and was assured all issues would be resolved on time and that I should call back which I did again the next day after the trip only to be informed they could not do anything, no compensation in any way.",24 August 2023

Late buses. Rude driversMy outward bus was 2 and a half hours late.  The return bus was 40 minutes late.  No apology.  No explanation. Both drivers rushed the passengers on to the bus.  They were impatient and rude as if the lateness was due to the passengers.,04 August 2023

"Lack of communication!I booked  my journey from Cardiff to London.Mega bus changed the bus stop because there was Cardiff City marathon, but never informed customers. It was really stressfull to find the right bus stop, with all the luggage.Additionally, bus driver was very rude , almost shouting at people and never apologised for the delay in picking up the passengers.To make up the time, I wanted to get off at Heathrow instead of Victoria coach station.Bus driver rudely explained that I can't get off, as Heathrow tickets are more expensive. It is the same bus enroute to Victoria, how is that possible! In any case, talking politely would not harm the drivers ego.",03 September 2023
"On the way home there were people…On the way home there were people sitting on our reserved seats. They would not move at first until the driver told them to move. There was also a 2 hour delay getting home because of the rail strike, surely your company should be prepared for such things happening & have extra transport ready to put on. It was a real fiasco",31 August 2023
Return Journey to LondonWe were very pleased with the actual service which was on time for both journeys.  The driver was pleasant and helpful.  The only drawback is the fact that the seats are so cramped.  My partner and I are both nearly 6 ft and we found the limited leg room a bit of a challenge.,26 August 2023

"Bus never came, caused severe issuesBus was meant to be at 3:00am, so my friends and I arrived at 2:00am as we had just left a music festival and had nothing else to do. We had to get to the airport to catch a flight so had no time for delays. Sat waiting for bus until 3:45am, 45 minutes after the bus was already meant to have left and we knew we had not missed bus as we were an hour early. Ended up having to book and pay for a different bus from a different company, which was very punctual and service was excellent. Sort yourselves out and at least inform customers if your bus is going to be over 45 minutes late. Disgusted and disappointed. Would like a refund as bus never arrived and compensation for the second bus we had to pay for despite having pre booked tickets.",28 August 2023

"Got me there on time despite #issuesI used the Megabus for the first time in years because of the train strikes. I was travelling from Preston to Glasgow. I knew the bus was delayed because of the live tracker on the website. It was so badly delayed that the next service arrived first and the driver kindly let me on his bus. As his bus was direct I actually got home shortly after the first bus had been due to arrive. There was no one at all at Preston Coach Station at all and no accurate arrival info. I don't think that this is really down to Megabus, more likely the Coach Station's fault, but this is my reason for four stars not five. Bus itself was comfortable and driven well. Even better when the driver remembered to turn on the power to the charging sockets part way through the journey.",25 August 2023

A friend who was visiting Scotland…A friend who was visiting Scotland booked the 5.32pm. bus to Edinburgh airport from Stirling bus station.  A station member of staff and the arrival board confirmed that the bus would arrive at stance two.    The scheduled bus did not come to this stance. Instead and unbeknownst to us and another three passengers a replacement white bus had parked in a different stance and seeing no one there left.  We tried to get help from the megabus helpline but it was not available.  On emailing megabus customer services their response has been less than helpful and we are left angry and disappointed.   I would not recommend this company’s service to anyone.,27 August 2023

And the people that were going to Leeds ie.me they didn’t care about. The bus that was supposed to go to leeds after my one was delayed 2 hours. When the replacement bus finally turned up the toilet has broken, and the air con was permanently on and was so cold.

The coach also had a toilet on it and charging points on the seats.The female driver was friendly and helpful, with a change to the driver at Birmingham.

We arrived at bus stops with people with tickets to get on but no seats available _ so was it over booked?. Although we had to wait at Edinburgh for over an hour for a replacement bus to arrive this was considered by driver as working hrs so included in his driving hours so apparently a 45 min break was a necessity at the side of the motorway but surely waiting at Edinburgh was a break in driving hours? What's the difference? Maybe 2 drivers at all times?.the stops meant no working toilet facility too!. There was no urgency from staff to get passengers to destinations for flights , trains etc..Everything was disorganised chaos.If inviting people for long journeys surely it should be made clear that there would be no opportunity to purchase food and drinks so passengers would need to bring sufficient provisions for their journey.",28 August 2023

"MegaBus = MegaDis’I travelled from Edi-Lon on Mon 21/08, returning on Sat 26/08The first time I used MegaBus I was able to reserve a seat.

I would never have reserved this seat and would’ve seriously considered alternative means of travel, had I known this to be the only seat availableAlso, the USB sockets weren’t working. Meaning I had no means of keeping my phone charged.On the return journey I was a bit more fortunate with where I sat. Despite having a better seat, I was extremely uncomfortable for the last 2-3hrs When I arrived in Edinburgh, I was suffering pain in my lower back.Wi-Fi was not available either coming or going. I was surprised to discover that only one bus in the fleet has Wi-Fi available, and that it hasn’t left the depot for more than four months.If/when I have to make this trip on my own again, making driving less favourable.

"Everything was great - except the lack of working charger ports in the busesSo for my first time using megabus this is how it stands.We got the 4.30am bus from Newcastle to London - took us only a few minutes to make sure we were at the proper bus stop which has a small sign on it.The driver was courteous and polite, checked the tickets and welcomed us aboard.We found our seats which were well signed and off we went.The only problem with the coach we found was that the ink board phones chargers didn’t work. Which was a problem for me because I needed to do some work on the journey.Luckily there was a plug opposite my position on the bus so I could plug in there but I was disappointed that the chargers weren’t checked regularly - many people has the same issue and it did cause frustration among the passengers.We got to London in good time - about 30mins early because there was a change of schedule at the last minute and our bus was changed to direct to London instead of doing all the stops. The original driver informed us of the change and asked if any one was going to anywhere other than London, after the driver change the new driver also informed the passengers of the intended change and made sure everyone was aware.Same for the journey back - our driver was Ian and he informed us all of the stops coming up and the timings, again at the change of driver we were kept up to date with timings and even though we were about 30mins behind schedule we were informed.Sadly again the charger ports weren’t working on this us either which again proved a frustrating point for all the passengers on board.",26 August 2023

"Bizarre experiencethe coach left roughly on time (1000) from Birmingham to Manchester but, a little disconcertingly, the coach stopped at the first services - Hilton Park - and the driver proceeded to tidy up his area and swapped drivers with a colleague(?). Why this couldn't have been done at Birmingham where there was a 40 minute stopover I don't know. I am assuming the change of driver was official, and not a private arrangement between friends, which could explain the following events. This 'relief' driver drove on while the original driver went to sleep on the front passenger seats. The coach did lose a little time (20 mins approx) due to the change of driver and minor traffic congestion as we negotiated junction 15. For some reason best known to himself the relief driver took the slip road at exit 18 (instead of 19) and then proceeded to head south on the M6. I told the driver he had taken the wrong exit and that it would be advisable to get off at junction 17 (Sandbach) and get back on the M6 north. He went sailing past junction 17 and by now my voice was raised telling him to get off at the next junction. This woke the original driver up and it took some time before he realised the situation. By now other passengers had noticed the problem. One family was particularly concerned as they had an international flight to catch from Manchester airport (out next scheduled stop). The original driver was speaking to the driver in a foreign language which I couldn't understand so I was unable to work out if he had any idea of what was going on. He kept telling us to get back to our seats as his first concern was safety. We were telling him that our first concern was to be heading in the right direction. Eventually the relief driver did get off the motorway and rejoined it heading north. I finally arrived in Manchester at 1310 - over 1 hour late. I am not sure whether the people managed to get their flight.",18 August 2023

"Cheap and ( not particularly) cheerfulI have to say that I found the experience, fairly unsatisfactory. I know in terms of a coach journey, there is not much the driver and their mate can particularly do. But I felt that the opportunity to make you feel a valued customer at "" ""meet and greet"" is very poor to non existent. The reserving of seats which you pay for extra for, is again a process that is non existent. My paid for seat was again sat in. Not too much of a problem as a single traveller. But didn't didn't get what I paid for. No explanation about WiFi, services( their aren't any)? The coach itself was clean and tidy, bag for rubbish on each seat. The luggage racks overhead are not really fit for purpose a small back pack, didn't fit. Seats pretty uncomfortable. The worse aspect was the toilets ( not used by me) the smell from them is pretty potent and makes you gag at times. I also e mailed to cancel my return trip , with a very polite request for any discount available. I didn't expect any , and didn't get any. The response was pretty rubbish, and did absolutely nothing to encourage me to travel with them again . As did nothing of the total experience. Would I travel with you again . Not unless I really had to. Hence the 2 star reviews. Nothing majorly wrong, but absolutely nothing was done to encourage me to travel with you again, so I probably won't.",24 August 2023

"Disorganised replacement taxis and unsafe seats on replacement coachOur first coach (and the one that was meant to depart an hour and a half earlier) had technical issues. Though replacement taxis were being organised, this was not being communicated to the crowd of passengers waiting. We managed to get into a taxi that got us to our destination, but there were easily 100 others still waiting for taxis to arrive.Then the coach home was a replacement vehicle and we were not allowed to sit in our pre-booked seats. We pre-book at the front to accommodate a disability. Instead we had to struggle to the very back of the coach and we’re uncomfortable the whole way. The driver was polite and stated that the front seats were deemed unsafe for passengers so we could not use them, very odd statement that didn’t inspire confidence. Quite worried about how things will be for the next trip we already have booked.",26 August 2023

On our return our seats were  booked but due to it being a hired Coach,again not the Megabus the trip.home was exactly the same,NO legroom yet again the 4+half hr journey the same thing happened both my knees had locked+l struggled to get off the coach,the passengers in B'ham helped me to get off as the driver was sorting the suitcases.The thought of another 50min journey to follow in a mini-bus home+being uncomfortable yet again became quite distressing but l had no other option.l appreciate you need extra coaches,but there needs to be more options for those of us registered disabled+not necessarily in wheelchairs to be considered to travel on your travel services.l continue to recommend the Megabus to friends,family,members of the public,but not so sure of people with dis- abilities sadly!!",04 August 2023
"The trip from london to Edinburgh M20…The trip from london to Edinburgh M20 on 24th August was a disaster. Coach was changed without any prior notice. 2 tier(floor) bus was changed to single tier. Reserved seats were changed to unreserved when asked while boarding it was told by staff to send mail to enquiry team they will refund reserved seat amount. Announcement at station given ""coach is being cleaned that's why there is delay. Empty wrappers and bottels on seats.When requested them for reserved seat staff said "" drop mail to enquiries for reserved seat refund, when asked to turn on air conditioning was told to get inside the coach or else coach won't move further"". Booked tickets in a row to enjoy the journey with family but we had to sit apart in available seats given. Finally bus started 30 minutes late. Air conditioning was not working. Was waiting for sometime so that staff will realize and do something about it. When asked they said they adjusted the settings which they dint do practical as they stopped bus for diesel filling in few minutes. Bus was stinking badly with body orders due to heat in coach. Later on after filling fuel it seems they turned on  air conditioning as it was just Lil better than worse. Guys please read all the terms and conditions before choosing this bus service. For complaints for current journey it might take 14 days for reply from megabus as mentioned in there site which shows how important is customer feedback for them. I was misguided by few posts/reviews and assumed it's best bus service. No wifi service. If customer has to cancel or change the trip he has to do it 48 hours before departure or else no refund, but the bus services and coaches, facilities can be changed right at the time of boarding without any notice to customer. How far is this correct or justified. No contact(email) of any management team to get this to there notice. This was not journey for 1 or 2 hours. It's for 9 hours and very horrible experience all together. Please be aware of rules and regulations before booking.",23 August 2023

When we were advised that our flight from Australia was being delayed by 5 hours I left a message with megabus to advise and ask if we can use the tickets for another bus. Heard nothing back and we ended up paying again with another service who had a kiosk at airport. Since arriving home I have emailed Megasbus last week and still have not had a response. Very poor customer service. We used Megabus to go Bristol to Heathrow and the staff on the bus said we could definitely get a refund but would not allow us a credit to use old paid for tickets. Additionally my partner booked Megabus for a return trip to Silverstone only to have that service cancelled with no alternatives offered. He did however receive a refund,",01 August 2023
"Cancelled service and a ridiculous alternative arrangementCan I share my truly awful experience with Megabus and the inept customer service offered by them.I booked an overnight coach between Liverpool and London for Thursday 17 August (departure time 8:05 PM; arrival time 4:40 AM).In anticipation for the arrival of the coach, I had been using the online Coach Tracker to ensure it was on time, and assured of this, I made my way to the bus station, arriving at 7:45 PM. Soon after arrival at the bus station, I checked my email inbox to find a short message from Megabus had been sent to me 15 minutes earlier (at 7:30 PM), reading:""Due to unfortunate traffic conditions, your scheduled Megabus service from Liverpool has been severely delayed. Please contact Megabus customer services and they will arrange alternative transport for you. Megabus apologise for any inconvenience caused.""There was no phone number provided in the email, so I had to search for this online. When calling for the first time at 7:58 PM, I was notified by an automated message that the office was closed at this hour, but I did manage to get through to someone eventually. I described the email I had received to the customer agent, and they told me that the coach had been delayed by an hour, and that I should wait at the bus station for it to arrive.Whilst not an ideal situation, I waited around. In this time, I did continue to check the online coach tracker, which appeared to show the coach in Manchester (the first stop following Liverpool), but still suggested a delayed arrival in Liverpool, with the time moving back towards 10:00 PM.At 09.21 PM, I called the office again and was advised that the coach would not be arriving in Liverpool after all. I was asked if I was the only passenger waiting at the bus station, which was the case. At this point they advised me that a taxi would be arranged to get me from Liverpool to Manchester, and that I should board the next available coach from there to my destination, which would be departing at 01:55 AM! This was clearly not an ideal situation, as I had already been waiting in the Liverpool bus station for 1.5 hours, and was being asked to take an hour taxi ride before waiting in an unfamiliar location (with no indoor - or outdoor - seating) for 3 hours in the middle of the night. Most astoundingly, I could see from the online coach tracker that my originally booked service had departed on time from Manchester, and was making its way to London.At around 9.40 PM (2 hours after first arriving at the bus station), I was on the phone to the helpline to request the full details of the alternative travel that had been arranged for me, as this had not been explained. It was only at this point I was told exactly where to wait in Manchester, and the exact time of the next bus arrival. I asked at this point if other arrangements could be made, as it was far from an ideal situation, but was told that they could not authorise anything else.A taxi eventually picked me up at 09.52 PM and drove me to Manchester, arriving around 11:00 PM. In this time, I called the Megabus helpline again. I asked whether the driver of the next coach I had been asked to board would be aware of my situation, to which they didn't have an answer, and only suggested that I tell them it had been authorised. I asked if details of this coach could be sent to me by text or email, as I was anxious that I would be waiting around in Manchester with an invalid ticket, and would have appreciated some form of formal confirmation to show when I boarded this service. They told me that they were unable to send me anything. I asked if I could have the service number of the 01:55 AM coach from Manchester to London, as this had not been communicated to me, and would at least allow me to track the coach online. It should also be said that I stressed my frustration with the alternative travel arrangement that had been organised for me, and whether they could authorise any alternative. Again, I was told no, and that I would have to wait in Manchester until 01:55 AM for three hours. At no point was I offered any compensation, reimbursement, or even a food voucher that could at least have given me somewhere warm to sit for this extended period of time during the night.I received no contact from Megabus following this journey, so I emailed them a few days after. They have refunded my fare and called this a 'gesture of goodwill', despite also admitting that I am entitled to this refund given the extent of my delayed arrival! (note that I had to get in contact for even this to be offered, despite it being one of their T&Cs). They have refused to offer me any actual gesture of goodwill, which I think is highly inflexible given the stressful journey they put me through.NEVER AGAIN!",17 August 2023

One mega bus parked up outside Fabric land. At 7am we asked if he is going to London he replies no. On calling customer services informed coach had departed. There was us and 14 other customers waiting. We have been informed it was a sub contracted coach (white with eurobus on side) which had a sign in the front window. customer services don't care, say coach was there and left and it is our fault. Surely the driver noticed he was missing 15 passengers.. stood about 20m away with suitcases etc. Nothing in their terms to say you won't get a megabus so be on the look out for any random coach and a driver who doesn't even shout out if any of these waiting passengers are for London.

Used to be my best but not after sleeping in the cold unprepared and wickedness of the bus driver. This happened on the 10th of August. 11:59 bust from Victoria to Edinburgh.",09 August 2023

"The experience was below expectationsThe experience was below expectations. Seats did not recline and for an 8 hour journey, it was very uncomfortable.I paid to reserve two seats, but my companion and I were unable to use them as other people sat in our spots. This also happened to other passengers who pre-booked their seats. This is not correct and there should be oversight of this.There is also no labeling of the bags placed in the luggage compartment, so someone else could take my bag by mistake.The driver was very kind and careful. We like him a lot!",10 August 2023
"Rude and inconsiderate  staff and delay19/08/23 - 20/08/23I missed my bus while traveling to Scotland (Aberdeen) before the bus we boarded from Oxford was a few minutes late. The lady at the gate was so inconsiderate, so rude, and nasty. The bus left while I was in front of her, with my 9month old baby and my husband. I understand the gate closes 2 minutes before departure, but a kind person would have still allowed us, considering the stress of waiting with a baby. We had to wait from 9:30 am until 11:30 pm to board another bus going to Glasgow after paying another £20. A colleague who missed her bus with the Flixbus never paid a dime, and they were moved into the next available coach to Scotland.14/08/23 - 15/08/23On our return, everything was going well until the coach broke down at Coventry, a journey that was supposed to be less than 12 hours turned out to take a ""decade"". If it was me alone, it would have been a lot easier, but I had a baby, that was one of the worst travel experiences I ever had in my lifetime.Now that Mega Bus did not keep their part of the deal, should I now also ask for a refund? I was asked to pay because I was 2 mins late to catch my bus, should you not also pay me because you delayed me for hours with a baby? Think about it.",12 August 2023
"I was travelling Manchester Airport to London HeathrowI was travelling Manchester Airport to London Heathrow on 12/8/23. The Coach broke down at Birmingham-on the way to London Heathrow. The driver and travel manager at the bus stop in Birmingham were not helpful told me ""fend for yourself”. Can’t help you other informing the bus can be fixed in 15 minutes or even 4 hours. I had to buy new tickets for the Birmingham-London Euston train and tube ticket from Euston to London Heathrow to get to London Heathrow to receive my relative at Heathrow airport. It was a mad rush to be able to get to Heathrow in time to receive my relative. There has been no acknowledgement from Megabus to apologise for the hardship caused to me.",12 August 2023

"Undue Delay and Bad customer CareFirstly, It was my first time using the Megabus from Manchester to Middlesbrough which was booked for 17:20 and the bus didn't arrive till 18:30 and eventually left almost 19:00 and when it finally arrived there was no apology or encouragement.Secondly while about to board the bus the Motorboy or driver (Whoever he was)asked what was in my bag and I told him I had a frozen meal as I never knew was against the policy being my first time using the bus which he could have said politely asking me to bin it but rather he was very rude and racist, he wasn't ready to let me talk or listen to whatever I was saying rather he ignored me and he used indirect insults and even threatened to leave without me boarding despite I paid for my ticket, he messed up my mental health that I cried while he was acting like a mini God and I was very shaken and I vowed never to have anything to do with Megabus because I haven't ever experienced such uncouth and mannerless attitude from Flixbus drivers in that same park , No one says he should work against the policy but courtesy is needed, he doesn't deserve that job and needs more training to work with humans and the better he realizes all humans are one despite color the better he will grow in life.",10 August 2023

"The disdain and discomfort of coach travel UKThe bus was late by 1hour and 10 minutes but no one thought to keep us passengers informed. It transpired after 50 minutes that an operative at the station new it had been 1 hour keaving its previous destination. Had we been informed we could have sought a cafe or seats that weren’t uncomfortably hard & filthy. It strikes me as coach travellers are treat with disdain by both the station owners and the operators. The Coach eventually left and it never made up any time. In fact as we approached Middlesborough just after 9.00 it looked as though we might not reach Newcastle till after 11.00 almost 2 hours late. However, at Middlesbrough we were asked to change coaches and went on a dedicated journey to Newcastle and arrived just after 10.00pm. The free WIFI was disjointed and heavily restricted throughout the use on the first coach. On the second unscheduled coach it was none existent. Neither was there PowerPoints on it.",09 August 2023

However, on both legs of the journey, we were advised not to use the restroom, and from the stinky smells that engulfed us for the whole time (abt 3 hrs each way), we understood why. If the situation could not be helped, why not text or alert passengers before they get on the bus, so they can get options? The fact that this happened on 2 different buses suggests that it's not a one-off, and this detracted from the overall pleasantness of the day.",10 August 2023

Support refused to give any refund or rebate even after many interactions. Do not ever use megabus if you can help it, they are an entirely belligerent company hell bent on stealing your money without any care to providing their service.Edit: In response to megabus' comment to this post, I contacted support and enquiries multiple times to no avail - they are trained to go round in circles to tire the customer out so they can save the company from having to give a refund.

However, coming back from London 1900hrs service M15 was horrendous. We boarded on time but that was the only thing that went smoothly. We started the journey and then stopped at a petrol station, the driver informed every one that the toilet on the bus was broken and if anyone needed to use the facilities there to go because we had another 2 hours journey. The driver came to myself and friends and said we should go use the toilet, we said we didnt need to go to the toiletand he kept insisting we should as they would not stop for another toilet break. We kept telling him we didnt need to go. He spoke to us like children. So we carried on with our journey. We got to Coventry where he announced there would be a 10 min toilet break. I told him that he had said we wouldnt be stopping again for toilet purposes and we would end up being late to get he last tram from Birmingham to get home, this fell on deaf ears. There was a hold up on the motorway which i know wasnt his fault so that was another 45 minutes hold up. We should of got into birmingham at 22.40 an got there just after midnight.

"Unfortunately this time it’s a 1 starUnfortunately this time it’s a 1 star. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars.This is because on 29/7/23 at 22:50 I was meant to catch the bus from Newcastle John Dobson street. Waited there for 8 minutes got there 8 minutes before departure time. It was time for departure and the bus didn’t arrive at the stop, but there was a bus standing opposite side of the road going in the opposite direction and it left at 22:50, so it made me wonder if that was the bus so tracked it after a few mins of departure it showed it has left so that was my bus standing at the wrong stop! And there was no sign saying on the actual stop that the bus is departing from the opposite side bus stop which is not a megabus stop. The driver nor the ticket checker came across and asked if there is anyone waiting for the london Victoria coach thats the bus there leaving now, no  one said anything and the bus driver drove off.Called the customer service they said we don’t know why it left from the other side but there is a bus in at 13:30 after 2.5 hours there is a seat you can take, so waited 2.5 hours at night in the cold the bus arrived and the driver said he has no seats available! So had to stay or all night and had to catch the bus next day had to buy a new ticket as the customer service said I have to buy another ticket and email customer services for a refund.So I have been emailing customer services and keep replying back saying we have done the checks and the bus left from the correct stop which it didn’t. I don’t think they have investigated or spoken to the driver and the staff of the bus,  if they have spoken to the driver then the driver and the ticket checker are lying. Customer services have been of Zero help no sign of courtesy at all. They said they cannot refund which they should have after doing the investigation which they didn’t as it is the drivers and mega bus’s mistake for departing from the wrong stop and they keep saying I’m lying and the bus left from the correct stop which it didn’t. This is not the first time I have travelled from that stop and I know which is the megabus stop.",28 July 2023
"Absolutely shocking serviceAbsolutely shocking service. I land at Gatwick airport at 1 am and get through customs at 1:45. I then book a 20-pound megabus for 2:55 am to avoid the extortionate cab prices back to London. I wait until 2:55 am cold and absolutely shattered however the Megabus doesn’t arrive. I wait until 3:30 am checking with stewards I was in the right place and that I wasn’t mistaken. I have now reached a point where I am so tired and concerned this bus isn’t turning up whilst also calling their tracking number to see when this bus is arriving, but straight to voicemail saying service is unavailable at this time.So I concede and get a 60-quid uber home on top of the 20 pounds I’ve just spent for the megabus. Clearly expecting a refund the next day I report my incident with customer care demanding a refund and they say they can confirm with me this bus did arrive an hour late and we won’t be able to refund you because the delay wasn’t more than 120 minutes!!!! 2 hours!!! In the middle of the night at 3am?!?! Absolutely awful service. Cannot refund me 20 pounds because they expected me to keep waiting for 119 minutes until I can receive a refund according to their terms and conditions. I urge you not to use this bus service and look elsewhere.This company has to alter its protocol for refunds so that it doesn’t apply to all time periods specifically in the middle of the night as it is highly unreasonable to be expected to be waiting at a designated stop for 2 hours after the due time to expect a refund if you don’t get on their bus.

Very disappointed travel to Bristol on…Very disappointed travel to Bristol on megabus all the time first time in Manchester didn't know there was two different coach station do I went to the wrong one on my way back so when I realised that I was at wrong one it was 15 mins for my bus leave from the other station so I phone you and you said it would wait for me for 10 mins so I took a taxi witch drove me there got there two minutes past and your staff did nothing to help me they said that I had to buy another ticket so we kind of argue because I tried to say that It wasn't fair. Then he called me forener told me to go back to my country really racist I asked him to speak to his manager this old man came acting as racist called me drunk and said that even if I buy another ticket he wouldn't let me on board. Really really umbeliveble.. So I had no other choice the going to the train station and pay £47 to come back to London otherwise I would sleep on the street. For that reason I'm giving you this score and I will never travel with you again unless you refund all the money I had to spend. Otherwise never travel with you again.Luiz Santos,26 July 2023

I have rated it with 1 star based on my last travel 23 July 23, from Derby  to London.  The driver was very rude, even though he said he was defending the law, the way he presented it to customers was very unkind.  He shouted to a family in Leicester that wanted to sit at the front with kids and he said if that happens  the journey will end there ,he won't driver the coach to London while kids are sitting at the front seats with their parents. On the motor way,we faces some traffic  to London around Luton area, so he took the slip road and left the motor way to avoid traffic, we ended up at service station for his break for 45mins. Customers got out and bought some Mcdonald he shouted at them like he was talking to donkeys that"" they can't take hot foods on the coach"".Many times I have been on Mega bus the drivers were from European countries, they were nice polite and little English, didnt say much, this time , the driver was English, may be he thought he was better than everybody else's.",22 July 2023

"Bus did not arrive, support refused any compensationI have been a regular customer of Megabus, and knowing the buses often leave earlier than the scheduled time departure, I am usually present 20 minutes prior to departure.Last time, however, the taxi dropped the four of us at the station 5 minutes prior to the scheduled departure, which was estimated at 23:20. The bus was not present at 23:15. As the board listed M10 (our bus) departure at 23:40, we thought there will be a delay. That bus scheduled for 23:40 also never appeared.I and my family needed to catch a plane, as we were flying to another country, so we had to spend £230 on last-minute train tickets and stand over 3 hours in the rain before the train station opened. Please note, that my parents are older people, this was an extreme discomfort for them, and we were left at midnight on our own, with nowhere to go.After this horrible experience, I reached the support of Megabus in order to offer them a chance to explain and compensate us.To my shock, no refund was offered with the reasoning, that they offer a refund only if the bus is delayed 120 minutes.I, again, stressed that this is not about delay, but about a bus that either did not arrive at all, or left earlier than 5 minutes before scheduled departure. I felt like I was not speaking with a person, but a bot, because it took them 5 e-mails to understand, that it was not about delay.They explained that the bus left the station at 23:22, which directly contradict our experience, the station board time, and the coachtracker time.Were we compensated for this disheartening experience, I would not have written this review. I understand mistakes happen, but it is important to take responsibility and compensate those who were affected. Your company did not do any of that.EDIT: As you can see per their reply to my review, they do not even care enough to read it - or the replies are written by a bot.The issue was not about a delay, but about a bus that either did not arrive, or left more than 5 minutes prior scheduled departure.",30 July 2023
"Daylight robbery and pathetic customer serviceComplaint - 14th July 09:15 service Plymouth - Bristol Airport. Ref AGI4MHIThe affected journey was on 14th July, when we were due to fly to Rhodes. We booked the 09:15 service from Plymouth - Bristol Airport for a 14:25 flight (travelling hand luggage only). The megabus driver was 45 mins late arriving for pickup at Plymouth Coach Station and by the time he messed about, he was 70 mins late leaving. During the journey, he continued to mess around, waste time and delay things further. As a result, we ended up missing the original flight, the alternative flight we booked (when the driver assured us of an arrival time -we missed that too) and then had to book another for the following day. We spent a total of £700 on flights before we even went anywhere, not to mention the loss of other costs incurred. Despite my clear and very descriptive email communications with Megabus, they persisted on denying any responsibility on the part of the driver and refunded the cost of the journey ticket. It was the drivers fault that we missed our flights that day - no one else was to blame and I think that Megabus have failed massively in their responsibility to provide a satisfactory customer service and resolution. I even threw an olive branch and suggested that a credit voucher for an amount equalling our losses could be a resolution - they wouldn't budge.I'm tired of greedy companies who are blatantly trying to claw back as much money as they can from their losses during COVID. Everyday people like me work hard for our money and I'm getting seriously annoyed with these money grabbing b***ards who have no humanity, no personality or compassion and take your money without even providing a half decent service.This country has enough problems as it is and I'm well aware that there are much worse things going on than this. However, this is daylight robbery and it needs to stop. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly do not recommend this company and I would be absolutely delighted if other people chose to avoid them too.P.S if I get a response from them on here telling me to email them on their enquiry line, we all know that they don't read the reviews. This is the email for which I originally made contact and have been in communication with since.UPDATEIn response to Megabus' reply - they clearly cannot read either. I have already had a refund for the cost of the ticket as the journey was 2.5 hours late. If the person who replied cares to actually read my review, all will become clear!",14 July 2023

The bus going to Perth left the Glasgow Station just as the bus from Manchester to Glasgow was entering the bus station. This is the 1st time I've had a bad experience. Next time I will have to choose a earlier bus for Travelling back home so that I can get home in time for other buses. I gave it a3star only because it costs me almost the same price in the taxi as it did for a return ticket from Perth to M/c.,25 July 2023
Shambolic…If I could have given a no star review I would but I suppose one is fair for not leaving us standed we're do I start firstly bus was late then it wasn't a megabus it was an old coach and as such not as comfortable hardly any of phone chargers worked but the more serious issue was the toilet it was a full bus and you'd think a basic health and safety check would have been completed firstly the light wasn't working and even worse was to come as the flush was broke why were these basic issues not picked up on as a diabetic I need to use the the toilet frequently after a couple of hours you were wading through urine after 5 hours we were told the toilet was full and we were allowed  a 10 min toilet break at no point was an apology given suffice to say I will never use your service again was extremely dissapointed,03 August 2023

"Easy and comfortable way to travelFirst of all 99% of my travelling is done by car and the rest by train. As a teenager (long ago now) I hated travelling by bus...smelly, uncomfortable, long! Not a positive experience.  However, Megabus has changed that and in future if I don't have a car and its within Britain I will certainly consider it. I had been in Folkestone for a week and was due to fly back Sunday night, however, Easyjet had a different view! After multiple delays we were virtually kicked out the airport with absolutely no support...except to use their app 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬. So, stranded in Gatwick at 9pm, needing to be in Edinburgh for 2pm I had to look at alternative...of which there were very limited. Decided to look at Megabus...the app was easy to use, clear to see my choices so I got my ticket booked.  The people at the station were lovely, extremely helpful and I got to Edinburgh on time. The drive up was great...it was comfortable, everyone was respectful and the trip was sooo easy. (Quieter than plane, more comfortable and no hidden charges for baggage). I even managed to sleep. The driver was great and extremely helpful.  This was a 100% turnabout of my previous experiences.  Firstly, I would NEVER fly with Easyjet again and next time I'm in Folkestone or down London way I will certainly use Megabus....thank you all for getting me home ❤",30 July 2023

"Really disappointed in the customer…Really disappointed in the customer service and response to an issue I had with a journey recently.After being advised by a member of staff that the bus I had booked on was not in operation I had to make alternative arrangements to get to work on time. After waiting to see if the bus showed up, again the gentleman advised that it was not scheduled and advised me to make alternate plans.When I asked to be refunded for my trip I was refused and told that actually the bus I booked on was in operation and because it was not late enough to qualify for a refund there was nothing to be done. The tone of the emails were clear in that they thought blame lay with me. I am left out of pocket and understanding that the word of an employee should have been ignored on this occasion.Very poor resolution and customer service.So far three customer advisors have been unwilling to accept that the individual I spoke to gave me incorrect  information, nor have they taken time to suggest that perhaps if this was to happen again that I could track my booked service to find out if it was indeed on route. If I had known this I would not have left the station. For a company as large as this you would think that customer service might be better and that resolution would be important to them.",31 July 2023

"The Megabus staff were greatThe Megabus staff were great. The woman in the office at Victoria Coach station was so helpful, specially after National Express staff were so unhelpful. It might help if Megabus puts where the office is on emails to passengers, so we don’t need to queue up at the information counter, at the other end of the station, to find out where it is. Also Andrey in Bristol was great - a good communicator, ever helpful to worried travellers.",29 July 2023

"Comfortable coach but timekeeping issues.Megabus was a comfortable coach and paying for extra legroom was worthwhile. The steep steps to enter and leave the coach were difficult for my husband to use as he has a walking stick and he didn’t attempt to use the toilet awkwardly accessed via the stairs and with a narrow door. The specific downside to our journey was that because they chose to wait for some passengers joining the coach in Birmingham, they left 50 minutes late which meant we missed our onward connections with the local bus company and arrived home  over 2 hours later than expected.  So a good service for a few passengers that the coach waited for, but not for those of us on the coach and picked up on the route or those waiting to making the return journey. Our first Megabus experience and I would consider using them again, but not if needing to be somewhere for a specific time.  I think bus should keep to timetable, when in their control, for benefit of majority of it’s users.",30 July 2023

"Do not recommendThe bus was missing it's driver's side mirror. The driver took the bus away to get repaired which resulted in us being delayed. Waited for an hour for someone to inform us what was happening. When one of the other passengers asked another driver what was happening to the delayed service to Cardiff the driver said that ""service wasn't delayed, it's cancelled"". Annoyed at the lack of information and communication we booked  another service home. I've always travel with national express the only time I decided to give megabus a go and this happened. Wouldn't recommend to anyone!",30 July 2023

According to the temperature gauge on the bus, it reached 26 degrees C.   A new bus should have been sent.2.  The seats in front reclined too far back which restricted the leg room of the passenger in the back.I am only 5'6 and this was a big issue.3. The bus was filthy.  There were trash bags slung over many seat arms.  They could have at least removed the bag before the new passengers came on.  I ended up slipping on a plastic bag thrown to the floor while coming up the side steps.  Clearly, no other sterilization or cleansing was done.4.  Bathroom was also filthy.5.

Over an hour lateOur bus was booked for 2245. It eventually arrived at 0010.This was our only way home from York to Leeds.,28 July 2023
"I pre-booked 15:50 Megabus from Birmingham to London Victoria…I pre-booked 15:50 Megabus from Birmingham to London 25/7/23. It was scheduled to arrive at London Victoria coach station for 19:35. With this in mind I pre-booked a train from Victoria train station to Ashford International for  20:25. When I arrived  for my journey from Birmingham the Megabus was there but it was awaiting a Megabus transfer connection of passengers from the Megabus from Preston. The driver assured me he would still make good time. Eventually after a delay of 45 minutes the bus set off for London at 16:35. As the journey progressed the driver then apologised once more to all the passengers & gave yet another re-assurance that he would make up the lost time as many customers had complained to him about the bus being late &  like me had pre-booked train timetables & other connections schedules. As the bus crawled down the motorway signs showed that there were 30 minute delays ahead & speed was restricted to 40 mph. Eventually as we left the motorway & headed down the A roads to Reading cars were snailing along & the driver was in no position to over take  them on a single lane & on many occasions the bus was being held to ransom by cars just driving along at 20 mph in these 30 mph single lane zones & you were praying for them to turn off at the earliest opportunity so that the driver could put his foot down & at least drive to the 30 mph speed limit. At this point it became obvious now too that we were not going to be on the scheduled times advertised & the driver then confirmed this unfortunate news on the PA as he had just received new ETA's from Megabus central control & announced that we would be at Reading Station at  7pm. Heathrow Airport 8pm & London Victoria 9pm. It actually turned out as as Reading 7:09 pm. Heathrow 8:16 pm. London Victoria. 9:12 pm. As the driver said apologetically to the disgruntled passengers on the PA at the time - ""Please don't shoot the messenger but take it up with Megabus."" Sitting on the bus as it crawled towards central London my heart sank as the clock displayed 20:25 & my pre-booked train had literally just left the station. The inevitable delay at the start of the journey meant I was stressed & anxious from the get go & cost me my pre-booked train fare to Ashford as well which meant I had to pay for another train. NB** I do not blame the driver for this fiasco  because he has absolutely no control whatsoever  of either the initial delay from Preston or over the 40 mph speed restrictions on the Motorway or the 30 mph speed restrictions in some of the quaint roads  through Oxford, Reading & in to London, though I do hold him responsible for strongly suggesting he would make up for the lost time at both the beginning of the journey & after the first 25 miles when we were crawling as he was clearly in no position to do so. The initial solution to this problem I would strongly  suggest is for Megabus to give more realistic timetables for both arrival & departure for customers to work to. To say this was a very, very frustrating trip to London would be an complete understatement. On a more positive note however, I have to say the driver on the return journey was absolutely fabulous & I thanked him for his great driving skill & stamina as he was prompt & on schedule for most of the stated designated departure & arrival times from London, stopping at Heathrow, Reading & then Birmingham & he also allowed for a 10 minute stop off  both for a toilet break & diesel refuelling  at Warwick services which meant we were only actually 15 minutes late to my final destination into Brunel St, Birmingham. Additionally this is the first time I've had a bad experience with Megabus & given the really fantastic prices on offer it is only with great reluctance that I'm complaining here. The salient point & salutory lesson I would recommend to all prospective potential customers of Megabus is to allow at least 2 hours in both boarding & unboarding the advertised Megabus timetables as frustrating as that may seem but as with most things in life you `Live & learn'.",25 July 2023

I accidentally booked a bus for the wrong day as it was just after midnight and I thought I was booking for that night ie for the following morning just after midnight. in fact I clicked the correct day above the booking, but it failed to import that information onto the booking page. But after I paid, I realised it was for the wrong day. So then I tried again and did exactly the same thing! On the third attempt I managed to get it right. I then emailed Megabus immediately and they just replied that I was shown the booking prior to payment and all the bookings in error are non-refundable. Of course, in the ideal world everyone would spend an hour booking and checking, but I do feel the layout of the booking form is something of a trap and I wonder how many others have been caught out in the same way. If the booking was at a ticket office, of course such a scenario would be impossible, but this is a fine example of the 'digital rip off' age we live in.

"Wont use again!!!First time of using and i wish i had read the reviews before i booked. I booked to go to Liverpool from Newcastle and paid to reserve a seat. The bus was due to leave at 10am and was told to be there early, about 9-45 or sooner. I actually got there about 9-15 which was very early but couldnt be helped. 10am came and went as did 10-30 and eleven oclock. By this time my back was in pain due to standing so long as there arent any seats in the pickup area. Some passengers were sitting on the ground at this point, im 70 years old and couldnt sit on the pavement. I looked at the coach tracker which said bus was due in 3 minutes after 5 minutes it said bus was due in 3 minutes again and this kept happening so i gave up on the tracker. I saw an online chat available and spoke to an agent, they said there was technical trouble but couldnt give me an ETA, they had no more information at all. At about 11-37 a single decker coach with the name Snowdens on the side pulled in. The driver got out and said this was a replacement for the Megabus. During the journey I tried to hold on for the toilet but couldnt, i opened the door and had to close it quickly it was absolutely disgusting and definitely a health hazard.The following day i emailed Megabus and explained what had happened and that as i didnt get my reserved seat could i have a refund. The reply said they do not give refunds unless the coach is 120 minutes late. This became a point of principal as the amount was only £2. I said so you sent a single decker coach without any reserved seating and i cant get a refund for something that wasnt my fault. Next email from them made me feel like they didnt believe i didnt get my reserved seat, they actually asked me if i could confirm i didnt actually sit in the seat id booked. I did get the £2 refunded but how many people dont bother because it is such a small amount. I wont be using them again, i got to my appointment with only a couple of minutes to spare, but the pain of standing so long and the stress of not knowing if a coach was even going to show up was terrible. 2 stars are for the drivers who were very friendly even though they didnt seem to know too much either.",21 July 2023

Poor Service. NIL Customer CareNo more direct coaches from London to Exeter or Plymouth. My connecting coach did not turn up in Bristol. No phone number to get information or support. Website suggests I contact them by Twitter during office hours. What’s the flaming use of that when it’s 8pm and you are stuck without a way to get home? Had to get another ticket to take the National Express. Won’t be using Megabus again. Appalling.Reply below states out of hours calls are redirected. But their telephone number is not shown clearly on the website or tickets - if at all. Only advice to contact via Twitter. So it is clear that Megabus would prefer not to deal with customers at all rather than resolve their problems.,25 July 2023

"MEGABUS Driver DROVE OFF with my BAGThe bus that was to pick the other passengers and I from Newcastle to Manchester delayed for over 30 minutes.Instead of the main Megabus coach, it was a ""chattered"" white bus that eventually came.To worsen the case, the toilet on the bus was bad hence no passengers could use it.As if that wasn't enough, the driver had to drive off with my bag when I went to use the toilet at Leeds.I logged my concern to MissingX.com as directed by the customer representative I had a chat with, after which I sent an e-mail to enquiries@megabuscomWhat else do you want me to do?Till this moment, my bag is yet to be returned and it's 9 days already.I'm really shattered as I type because of the contents in my bag.I'm so disappointed and dissatisfied with Megabus service.I'll rather look for another alternative in the future.",16 July 2023

Awful serviceThe bus was over an hour late arriving in Birmingham no one knew why. It was pouring rain and no shelter to stand under there is a shelter but too many people waiting for buses. Time bus arrived I was soaked through.When on the bus it stank of urine from the toilets….. this happened last time I was on a mega bus …. The window leaked on my reserved seat meaning I was constantly having water drip down my arm and side. Luckily no one was in the seat next to me so sat there.Unfortunately due to my continuous bad service I will not be using mega bus again……I regularly travel by coach on a fortnightly basis and will not be using this company again. I would also not recommend them to anyone either. Sorry Mega bus…. Clean up your coaches and have a more reliable service.,13 July 2023

"Awful experienceAwful experience. From Heathrow to Manchester, started with being 25 minutes late which is understandable due to train strikers and it being a Saturday. Got instructed by a Megabus Driver to get onto the Scott’s (white) coach instead of the mega bus as I was going to Manchester. Both buses were going to Manchester. Driver did not check my ticket. Got to the midlands pretty fast and had no complaints… However being in the midlands was where the problems began, wrong way down some dodgy road, then drove around the same loop in Birmingham for an hour and half. The bus finally left Birmingham after driving around the same area for over an hour and a half. It made its ways to Manchester around 7:30pm, 2 hours after its set time. Missed the Airport stop, even though people instructed the driver that they needed to be dropped at the airport. Get to Shudehill in Manchester 2 and a half hours away set time. Awful experience and will not be using the Megabus’ again. Understood not to rely on the Megabus before getting on and time would differ, however the hour and a half around Birmingham doing the same loop just seems pure stupidity.",21 July 2023

"I have already written to MegaBus to…I have already written to MegaBus to explain why I am giving this a 1star. Although the individual staff at Manchester deserve 6stars! My main negative is that I was on a 7hour bus ride &, once again, the toilet was defective. The driver announced at 1 point that there was a public facility (which you had to pay for) opp 1 specific drop-off on the route, but otherwise tuf. 1 passenger (who had boarded after he allowed us off for a minute) asked & was told the facilty at that drop off was ""too far away"" if the passenger got off to find it he would drive off & the passenger would be left (wothout his ligguage) to find his own way. When that person asked how far to the next he was told he'd have to wait through 2 other drop offs, until we reached the customers destination (& final stop) which was  3+hours. His attitude was so bad I got off 2 stops early. But at the same time MegaBus have nothing in place as a procedure/protocol of how the drivers are to act in this case. Which I told them. But their response was that they'd raise a disciplinary with the driver. NOT instigate new procedures",10 July 2023

On the return journey from Edinburgh to London, again the journey was left on time, however, Megabus double booked our prebooked seats leading to an argument between us and a Polish couple, not great.Also, for future reference, don't book seats towards the front of the bus as you can clearly here the driver's conversations for majority of the journey some of which contained some very colourful language.Apart from this the journeys were good, departed and arrived on time, and were as comfortable as you can get on a coach, and a decent price.",08 July 2023

"Disappointing Experience with Megabus UKOver the last two months, I have had multiple experiences where coaches were delayed without any proper communication or assistance. Additionally, the lack of a clear returns policy has resulted in me losing five tickets, which has been both financially and emotionally taxing.While I had previously heard positive reviews about Mega Bus UK's affordable prices and widespread routes, my recent experiences have greatly diminished my trust in the company. The lack of punctuality and the absence of a transparent returns policy have made me hesitant to book future trips with them.In conclusion, my encounters with Mega Bus UK have been far from satisfactory. The frequent delays and ambiguous returns policy have resulted in a frustrating and costly ordeal. As a customer, I expect better communication, reliable service, and fair treatment.

Megeripoff.Well as I missed my bus through no fault of my own I would assume I would of either been able to get a refund or transfer my tickets for another time but no instead megabus gets to keep the money which to be is not a good way of running a business.I am appalled on how I was treated and i won't be using this service again. 0/10 for everything.,13 July 2023

Always love trips to London on Megabus…Always love trips to London on Megabus 💚💚,12 July 2023
Good trip!I have not been on a Megabus for years and I was really surprised by my most recent experience.  The bus station itself had been revamped and was modern and easy to navigate.  The megabus stand was clear to find and the bus arrived on time.  The bus driver was helpful and confirmed my seat number.  The journey was smooth and uneventful.  The seat was comfortable and I had a decent amount of space.  No one was sitting next to me though which admittedly was better.  The plug socket next to me didn't work though so I couldn't charge my phone (the only thing to moan about!).  But I arrived at the destination on time and I would definitely use Megabus again.,14 July 2023

"Reclining SeatsReclining Seats. I very much appreciate being able to recline on a long journey. However, it appears that there is a reduction in seating space provided. Hence, when the seats are fully reclined, it affects the passenger behind the reclined seat. I was unable to easily access my seat due to the limited space when the seats in front of me were reclined and also the customer behind me complained when my seat was reclined. A small bag can be placed under the seat in front of you, but this restricts leg movement which can contribute to Deep-Vein-Thrombosis. I am extremely disappointed in the limited seating space.",15 July 2023

Got picked up at 5.10pm at Southwaite, headed home but the driver wasn't told that the M74 had been closed since 2.36pm due to a crash. Eventually got dropped off at 11.55pm, 5hr 40mins after we were meant to arrive in Glasgow. Not the fault of the driver at all, he should have been informed of the road closure. If the people at Stagecoach had told the people at Megabus, same company, the driver would have been able to take a different route and got us all back at a reasonable time. Very poor service. It's cheaper than the train but pay the extra!!",13 July 2023

I don't know what went wrong but the…I don't know what went wrong but the journey from London Finchley Road to Leeds took 7 hours instead of 4 1/2. Then when it arrived the coach couldn't park as another Megabus coach was occupying the one allotted slot so more minutes were lost till we got offloaded in a side street. The coach had then to go back to its slot to pick up the customers for the onward journey. Maybe none of this was Megabus's fault but it would have helped if the driver(s) had given us some info - not a word of explanation during the whole journey!,13 July 2023

"Travelled on Friday 14th to Leicester…Travelled on Friday 14th to Leicester that journey was fine no problem arrived on time to collect us from Sunderland and arrived in Leicester about half an hour late due to traffic.The journey home however we got on the coach which said the mega bus to Newcastle asking the driver is this the one that stops at Sunderland he said yes. On we get, we reserved our seats and go to see someone else has sat in them he then gets his phone out to say he’d reserved them? The driver checks we definitely are on the correct coach and said the only thing we can do if we want to sit together is to sit behind him. So that’s fine no problem we did that.Anyway the journey was fine until we pulled in and the driver had to swap. The driver that got on was rude and she instantly told us to move I said we can’t and explained and then the other driver explained to her he told us to sit there. She then said well as soon as we get to Leeds and people get off you two will have to move. I’ve never met anyone as rude as her. I was sat there with my 70 year old mother it wasn’t as if we had been making any noise. Anyway again I double checked with the other driver your definitely goi g to sunderland arent you and he said yes because I’d heard the lady outside telling some passengers we are going to Newcastle. Off we go she drives on and eventually drops the other driver off and he said goodbye he was very polite and we continue the journey to Leeds when we arrive at Leeds the driver gets off and opens the boot once all the passengers have left she comes on and tells us we now need to move so as we happened to get our bags I checked again with her we are stopping g at sunderland aren’t we and she said “No” I counted believe it with the amount of times I’d asked. We then had to get off get on another coach at which left within about half an hour then we continued our journey but when we arrived at middlesborough the driver said there was something wrong with the tyre so we had to wait for the next coach. So although my journey to Leicester was fine. My Leicester coming back to sunderland was terrible it took 3 coaches and the female driver had the worst attitude.",15 July 2023

When I was getting in the bus again with the hot drink, they didn't allow me to take it inside the bus. I called my family outside the bus, they did sip in some coffee burning their tongue in hurry, then had to bin the left over hot drink and get inside the busNo one can buy and drink in 5 minsAgain this may be a rule that the staff is following but that could have been made clear, before I was going buy that.

Good timing but some issuesBus departed Victoria 10 mins late but we actually arrived in Glasgow 30 mins early so the actual journey time was 40 mins less which is fantastic on an 8 hour journey. I had a couple of issues- the first being the toilet door would not stay closed and I was sitting directly next to it meaning I spent a lot of the journey having to close it. Secondly the air conditioning was too cold. On an overnight journey it should be warmer to enable people to sleep so it wasn’t the most comfortable experience. 4 stars given for the early arrival,14 July 2023

"They cost me almost my flight and denied the refundI recently had a highly frustrating experience with this bus company while traveling to the airport. The bus encountered issues along the way, and despite being initially informed that a replacement bus would arrive within 10 minutes, the situation quickly deteriorated. First, they mentioned an engineer would come to fix the problem, but after waiting for an hour, no assistance arrived.In a desperate situation where time was running out, I had no choice but to pay £50 to a stranger for a ride to the airport. It was a costly arrangement that I was forced into to avoid missing my flights.Upon contacting the company for a refund, I was met with disappointment. They claimed that since the delay was less than two hours, they were unable to provide any form of compensation. This lack of accountability and unwillingness to address the inconvenience caused is truly disheartening.Overall, my experience with this bus company was deeply unsatisfactory. The failure to promptly resolve the issue, coupled with the lack of willingness to take responsibility, reflects poorly on their customer service. I strongly urge others to consider alternative transportation options to avoid similar ordeals.",14 July 2023

The money was gone! Awful system and no warning so that I at least book a round trip or make a better booking. I contacted the customer service to complain and they didn’t understand what I was talking about till I gave up. Will I travel with them again, I will never do it.

"Wicked and untrained Female Drivers …Am very disappointed with a certain female driver, on 15th June i and my little daughter 3yrs old arrived Newcastle airport then going to Middlesbrough being my first time in Unite kingdom, I was waiting for the bus for 2hours at Tyne John Dobson street bus stop Newcastle, only for the bus to arrived by 1am and told me that I need to book online for me to enter the bus, I beg her to accept cash or card payment that we are new in UK she refused,I beg her to allow me and my little 3yrs baby to enter the bus so I can book and pay for the bus since she can’t wait for me to booked for it, she refused I beg her to consider my little child on the cold sleeping, this same woman refused and zoom off the bus, I have to wait outside on the bus stop for 2-3hour on the cold at night for another bus to come out, since then my little baby has been sick of cold..am highly disappointed that a woman or mother could treat a little child that way…",15 June 2023

This service is value for moneyThis service is value for money. More over when I tried contacting the customer due to an issue for which I had to cancel the ticket the company responded quickly and also refunded the ticket. Given the timely response of the company especially at times of difficulties I would like to recommend this company%As for areas of improvement the local customer service seem not to be well connected and sometimes repeat the obvious like a parrot and hence we were forced to contact the head office.,02 July 2023
Arrive In Style With MegabusThe journey was very good but as with all bus routes they are subject to disruption and this was the case with my journey.Never the less I will use the service again because traffic delays are not the fault of Megabus and that's the way to travel and a bargain too.,30 June 2023

Megabus VirginsA great journey from Manchester to Bristol and return journey.We reserved our seats going but no option to reserve coming home which was a shame.A great price for the journey as it took just over 5 hours and less stressful than driving.Made a nice change to be driven.On the return journey the charger for the phone wasn't working and could hear water sloshing about in the panel so may have caused the issue.On the whole we will be using Megabus again for future travels.,03 July 2023

Myself, my partner and other passengers could not sit in booked seats, and myself and my partner couldn't even sit together. Other passengers who could not sit in booked seats were crying due to having booked seats in a specific place to avoid travel sickness and not being able to sit there or together. An absolute shambles. Due to arriving an hour late, we missed our appointment. On contacting Megabus to explain the above and the cost to us emotionally and financially, the reply was that sorry, but these things happen and unless the delay is more than 90 mins they don't consider it late. They did refund £4.00 for not being able to sit in our booked seats!! Disgusting. Will not be using Megashambles again.",30 June 2023

Available on Social media to change a booking? How clear is this on the website ? What happens when one does not have any social media account? Like I said your chat was not responding either!When I searched online found a number charging a lot to call. So did not travel and my £90 was lost.

Toilet stinks in a bus with no air circulation. Drivers are rude. Never on time.This is my second experience on megabus. First one was considered a one time thing cz technical problems happen. This is second experience in 3 months gap.Driver stopped at a station and asked everyone to get out so that engineer can rectify the problem. After 30 mins wait he says engineer can't reach so we will go to Manchester and rectify or arrange another bus. And they do nothing at Manchester amd continues the journey.

It was our first experience of MegabusIt was our first experience of Megabus. The only hiccup we had was our destination was not listed on the rotational display on the front of the bus. We were going to Leeds and the ultimate destination of the bus was London. We thought there must be another one. It was only a conversation by another passenger with the driver that prompted me to ask the question was it going to Leeds. Otherwise we were more than happy with the outward journey. We booked 7 weeks in advance for our return journey only to have a section of it cancelled 2 weeks later. We had to cancel it all and get a refund.

And came right up to my face and as I had my 15 year old daughter with me I replied ""let me get off"" and as I brushed past him to get off he physically kicked my downstairs which resulted in me having to grab the handrail and my daughter so we didn't go flying down the stairs I let my daughter off and turned round to face him and he proceeded to try kick me in my face luckily I managed to grab his foot before I got hurt and when he asked my daughter if we had any bags to get off the understorage of the coach she said yes and he threw them off the coach breaking some of our valuables absolutely disgusting service will not be going with megabus again and do not reccomend",01 July 2023

There were a number of seats marked as reserved but passengers appeared to be sitting anywhere. I found this disappointing and I think I will be requesting a refund of the £2.The 2nd thing I found annoying was that the passenger in front of me wanted to recline his chair.

So I had to say to the young lady near the aisle if she could adjust her seat so that others could sit down.  She only lifted it up slightly ...What a stare I got from her!!!.

"what has happened to Megabusbus was late by over an hour and did not know if it would arrive or not. Told by a driver going to Liverpool that it could be up to 2 hours late as bus coming from Doncaster, which is ridiculous! He was ken to take us to Leeds to save time but was not allowed to do so. Another passenger waiting said on twitter it stated 30 minutes delay. A coach arrived=- not Megabus- another company and the bus smelt terribly of urine so obviously the toilet had not been serviced. Arrived at Sheffield an hour late. Not a comfortable coach  ride compared to Megabus as I suppose the driver was not as smooth as trying to make up time. The waiting was terrible for me as I have mobility problems and cannot stand for long and I had to lean against the bus stop post and support myself with my stick for almost 2 hours as there are no seats at John Dobson street and could not leave the bus stop as no idea when the bus would arrive .a text could have been sent to tell me the time of arrival and I could have waited elsewhere.",18 June 2023

"Excellent Megabus Falcon DriverI caught the 1910 Megabus / Falcon from Bristol Airport to Plymouth. The coach arrived around 1900 so plenty of time to pick up all the passengers, the driver who was well mannered and smartly dressed didn’t rush anyone onboard and made each person feel welcome. He loaded our luggage for us  too.He made a clear safety announcement and announced each stop before arriving at them giving good time for people to gather their belongings.  I’m a frequent traveller on the Falcon and this has become extremely rare.His driving was very smooth and comfortable, he kept us updated throughout the whole journey and we were on time even with time to stretch our legs at Exeter.    The driver had a diversion to contend with which didn’t phase him in the slightest and again he kept us all up to date throughout the diversion and the knock on effect that it had (less than 5 minutes).This driver is a credit to Megabus and Stagecoach Falcon. I hope this finds its way to the driver as his efforts were appreciated by many, a lot of people were commenting on how well this driver promotes your business.I use the falcon frequently and I hope to come across this driver again.",03 July 2023

"7 hours when supposed to be 5 hoursI chose mega bus over national express as it was the quicker option. Mega bus was 5 hours each way for £8 more than national express, which was 6 hours each way. My outbound journey ended up being over 7hours. I chose a coach journey over my usual train choice due to the cost of trains increases to unaffordable prices. However, I have a disability which makes it very hard to sit still without movement for long periods so the 5 hours was going to be difficult but the extra 2 hours were dreadful. I understand that due to traffic and unpredictable events the journey can take longer but I think there should be a compensatory scheme for these times, as the trains offer when their journey is delayed for over 15 minutes. I think just £30 less than a good quality train journey that is half the time, is a bit much for the service.",29 June 2023

"Megabus is a very reliable companyMegabus is a very reliable company, my first experience was more than satisfactory. The drivers and boarding staff were all pleasant and a worker at Victoria station was extremely helpful and got me on another coach to Bristol. Just to add, make sure you specify Megabus or Victoria National Line coaches because I was told to go to the wrong gate and I missed my bus. Megabus was very helpful and I wasn't even upset because I realised that I didn't actually say Megabus at the desk, I just asked which gate was it for Weston- it was my first time travelling so I was focusing on getting the location and time right, not realising that I should have said Megabus because if I did say it, they wouldn't have sent me to the wrong gate and I wouldn't have missed my connecting bus from Bristol to Weston Super Mare where I had to take a bus and a train to get to Weston which was cool- it was like a mini adventure and I met some lovely and interesting people on my journey which is one of the nice things about travelling but obviously I could have avoided the scenic route!

Megabus was late to go to LondonMegabus was late to go to London. There were people who did not know if it was the correct coach. It is not clear on the sign at the coach station where it was going.,29 June 2023
A messed up tripThe 11 o'clock bus arrived before the 8 o'clock. When a bus did arrive it was 9 o'clock and nor even a megabus. Then told by driver the there were only 40 seats for 65 passengers and that taxis would be provided.  When we managed to get on me and my partner had to sit in the only vacant seats and not in our reserved places. Not what we wanted on a 3 hour trip..because of the delay our connection was missed.,30 June 2023

"Very poorVery poor.  I paid for leg room which i never received.  They sent a coach with no leg room?  Where's my refund?The toilet is so tiny how is a larger person meant to fit in it or turn around?  There is never no toilet roll ever, or clean water to wash your hands nor never no soap.  Quite a horrid experience to be honest.Cheapoe travel where you don't even get what you paid for nor basic hygiene in the toilet, with no toilet roll ever or even water or soap to wash your hands.  So every one is just spreading germs every where!HORRID EXPERIENCE!",01 July 2023

"Good , bad and ugly.Very understanding and professional staff. It was our first time using mega coach.However I would also like to comment that that its unkind for passengers to travel without a visit to the service station. Diabetics need a bit. 2pm to 10.00pm without a hit is inhumane. There should always be a stop at the the service station for both buses without fail otherwise people are bound to faint.Toilets:O My God. The smell of the toilets is just unacceptable. No human being should travel more than an hour with a stinking toilet. It happened on my wa to machester and even worse back. There was no water to wash hand. No toilet rolls. We had to use hand sanitiser after using the loo.  Can the toilets not be emptied at 3very stop. At some point some one went to the loo and the rest was history for the rest of the passengers. Please please do somethingGetting stuck in traffic on an empty stomach and a very sticking toilet probably explains the price. Hopefully this gets sorted out.",03 July 2023

"Terrible ExperienceI was a passenger on one of your mega bus coaches (M22)from London Victoria to Sunderland on Sunday at 16:30pm.Reservation number: 59/60-7242-020723-M22N-1630-LON-SUN-21,22.I am an NHS staff heading to Sunderland for a training and I must say the driver and attendants, especially the driver from London (till we swapped coaches) of that service were unfriendly, unkind, racially selective on who the would attend to politely.At the start of the shift, I had to throw away my burger which was properly enclosed in a box away because your attendant told me I couldn’t get on the bus with it. My burger wasn’t hot.We got Roadchef, Newton, Alfreton and noticed the driver pulled up and got down, we waiting for at least an announcement to know what was going on but he did nothing but stayed outside having a cigarette. We the passengers slowly started getting down about close to 10 minutes to see what was going on, this was about 21:10pm.Some got down to stretch their legs, I myself got down to stretch my legs because I have an arm string injury. On getting down, I asked what was going on, he was rude with his response. We asked if it was a break, he only said it wasn’t a break and nothing. One of the passengers who looked African asked him if we can go get something from she shops and he replied very rudely saying ‘I don’t care, this isn’t a break, the bus would leave you anytime soon and I don’t care, you are adults’. When another passenger with a white skin colour asked, he responded politely.After hearing and seeing this, I was worried, I went back in the bus promptly. After getting in the bus and waiting for an extra 10 minutes, I got to hear that he was actually waiting for a driver to come take over but the driver was now running late.This information wasn’t communicated to us when he initially pulled up to a stop. We never got a time to rest our legs, no form of announcements, this moment was a moment we could have conveniently used to stretch our legs after 5/6hours being seated.The next driver then turned up and the driver immediately told us to switch to another bus without any prior notice. We all had to horridly transfer into another bus while the rain was drizzling.After getting into the next bus, the new driver left us waiting there at the same location till almost 10pm without any form of announcementsThis was a terrible service and way to treat people. This is the first time I am using mega bus to Sunderland, I always use National express. I am afraid I would be giving a negative review for this journey and never using this service again.Lastly, the arrival time to Sunderland was 00:50 but we got to Sunderland at 2:30am.I am having a mentally horrible and stressful day currently because I am not well rested from that journey. The drivers gave no notice of any chances to the journey, I was so confused.The information I am giving you right now is so accurate.Please, I would be on the look out for your reply.",01 July 2023

"Poor serviceThe journey up was ok but on the way back was terrible. The driver after the first stop shouted at the passengers accusing someone of vaping but there was nobody vaping. He appeared to drive fast just so he could have time to have a cigarette at the stops.Then when we got to Cardiff the next scheduled stop was Swansea University but sat in Cardiff for ages nobody explained why. We left late. Then we went the wrong way back towards London in order to pick people up from a service station. It was only a couple of miles but we only picked up two passengers yet it was to the detriment of the 15+ passengers who were still on the bus.All this resulted in being late back, the person picking me up wasn’t happy and I was late to pick up my daughter.",01 July 2023
"Great service turned unreliable just recentlyThis is the 2nd time in June where our trip has been completely disrupted. The first on 10th June when our bus broke down. I know these things happen but it was the fact that the information we were given was wrong. We were told that an engineer was coming out as well as another bus and it would be an hour. 2 hours later the bus was able to set off but diverted to some services on the outskirts of London to swap passengers. It took us just over 7 hours to get to London. We had booked to go and watch Trooping the Colour, which we completely missed. The 2nd time the bus was later but when I checked the tracker there wasn't anything showing. A woman also waiting called customer services and was told there was a delay of 100 minutes. This was before 0500 and based on the upset a couple of weeks previous we decided to go back home. I emailed to request a refund and it was confirmed that the delay was longer than 2 hours.I am still waiting for my refund in connection to the 10th June, which I have had to chase up.I have used megabus for a number of years now but just recently I'm always left wondering how my day is actually going to turn out.",29 June 2023

"URGENT REQUEST FOR OVERCHARGED FAIRHi,My name is Nwenekanma Igwe, I actually boarded the Megabus Falcon from Anchor Way- Bristol to Winscombe Hill-Somerset  yesterday at 17:37pm Ticket No: 2227 and Bus No:54320  DRV:8508145. This was a 45 minutes journey and I paid £17.80 single return ticket in error(I paid with my Revolut Bank  card). When the driver dropped me off at winscombe Hill bus stop, he told me he taught I was going to Plymouth and that was the reason I paid that much  he didn't refund my excess charge to enable me pay for the actual fare of £4.50 thereabout which was in his power/ right to have done. As I boarded a return bus this morning (Sunday) and complained to the driver, he advised me to complain to customer service hence me reason for contacting you. kindly reverse my excess charge. No one has attended to my complaint.Thanks.",30 June 2023

Brilliant but check what stop works best for youMegabus is a brilliant service. From Leicester to London. Only thing we realised once we were on way home is that there is a stop at Finchley Road before Victoria station. If you stay on to Victoria station it takes 40-60 mins between these stops whereas if you get off at Finchley it takes a few minutes on the tube. So next time we are going to get off & back on at Finchley instead of victoria. This gives us up to an extra hour each way.,30 June 2023

However, the coach did not come to the station on time. and we saw that M11 and M15 bus are coming to Station NN on time. I tried track the coach again but it does not not work. One of the girl called Megabus customers service on 2:20 and the result is the coach had come indeed but it stopped in the Shudehill interchange (Station A to G).so that the receptionist think that it was our fault. I say ""what?"" The tickets said that we needed  to wait in Shudehill station NN and the result said that we miss the bus and only situation is buying another ticket to Bristol but higher price.

"Replacement Coach Not Fit for Several Hours' TravelUPDATE: After several emails backwards and forwards, Megabus have apologised and are sending a refund. Thank you Megabus! Four of us were due to be travelling up to Sheffield on 22nd June for my son's wedding. The Megabus should have arrived at 9:30am but there was an hour and a half delay so we didn't actually board until 10:55am. We were advised of the delay but were told it was something to do with the 'toilet drop'. I'm presuming this is to do with emptying the chemical toilet on the coach. It was only later that we overheard someone say the coach had broken down but nothing has been confirmed for definite. We would have dealt with the delay but the replacement coach was supplied by Snowdonia coaches or something similar and not fit for a journey to Sheffield, never mind it's final destination of Glasgow. We had reserved seats and a table but there were none on board and all passengers were told to sit anywhere. To be fair to Megabus, I did receive an email at 9:38 saying we would be given  a refund for the reservation fee which I have now received. However....we were told not to use the toilet on the replacement coach and that we would be making toilet stops along the way. Well, we had one 45 minutes before arriving in Sheffield. I am 5'6"" and my knees were touching the seat in front of me so goodness knows how anyone taller managed! There was barely any space and it was not comfortable to be sat on the coach for any length of time. The worst part was that my son and his girlfriend were sitting behind us and when my son dropped something on the floor and picked it up, it was wet and smelled strongly of urine. He looked down and the floor was wet so we can only presume this was indeed urine. There was also something on the floor which looked like fecal matter! I supplied photos of this to Megabus and asked if our outbound trip could be refunded fully but I just get: ""there's nothing we can do, apologies for the inconvenience"". Surely this is a health hazard?! No one should have to sit with their feet in urine for a minute, let alone several hours! Surely the coach should have been checked before it was boarded?! I think it is disgusting that I have been fobbed off in this way and I'm only giving 2 stars because the journey home was a much more comfortable experience. Shame on you Megabus! I will never travel with you again and would recommend others to avoid!",22 June 2023
Policy not user friendly and lost moneyI requested for change and add luggage but the customer service denied. I asked to cancel the ticket as it was not possible to travel with out luggage. No luck on the name of company policy. Eventually i did nt travel and my money got wasted. Policy of the company is not user friendly and i had a bad experience.,15 June 2023

The bus was late againThe bus was late again. The time tables should be rescheduled to allow for the traffic between Victoria and Heathrow. Also why the bus goes via A roads and not the M4 to Reading is a mystery. The quickest and safest routes are the motorways. Even around Birmingham the route uses A roads and not the Aston Expressway which it used to. Fortunately I was not put out but alot of customers were by the late arrival at Heathrow on the 1st of June it arrived at 21:00 not 18:30 not helped by the lateness of the relief driver en route,01 June 2023

"Bus Driver Was Texting Whilst DrivingI reviewed whilst I was on my actual journey with you but seeing as you keep emailing here it is again, I missed my first coach (maybe a blessing) so I booked on National Express so I seen the contrast of the two companies.On the way back the journey was 1 hour 20 minutes over the allotted time, traffic cant be helped but it meant 1 hour and 20 minutes at the back of the bus and finding it difficult to breath because the air conditioning was not on, did not work or just rubbish, I dont know. I went down to the driver to see if he could help us to breath and he was texting on his phone. I have PTSD from a car accident so I was not too happy to see him texting. I said to him he should not be doing this and he said he was texting his manager like it was okay. I did not feel safe on my journey after seeing that and there was no iproivement with the air condiitoning so over four hours of heated hell. I have hot flushes on top of it!It then got to the stage where I wanted to go toilet, I didnt want to use the coach toilet but when thinking of rht eother option at Victoria Coach Station the coach was the better option. I went inot the toilet, there is no toilet roll and the water did not work.I had to go and get tissue to go and i walk wiht hand sanitiser.My journey has put me off Megabus and I guess you get what you pay for.",17 June 2023

"Absolutely appalling customer serviceAbsolutely appalling customer service! Had booked for the 11.59pm coach from London Victoria on Saturday evening 24/6. At 11.40 a tannoy message said this was ‘generally delayed’  And then we heard nothing more. The station staff knows both staying Megabus staff had gone home and they did not know what was happening. I managed to find a customer service number online and was informed by the operator that she could not say if the coach was going to turn up as it had broken down’in London’! Couldn’t give an ETA. Said that if it didn’t turn up there was no guarantee that any of the stranded passengers would get on the next coach out, leaving at 7.00 in the morning. This is unacceptable behaviour. The passengers remained good natured but not having any updates was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The coach finally arrived two hours later. Megabus could have least sent out an apology to all affected.  Shoddy!!!",23 June 2023

"Delay!I was travelling from Glasgow to Liverpool with a change at Preston. Both journeys were fine, but the connecting bus was an hour late and the tracking service for the bus said it wasn't trackable, which made it a bit concerning for some, as we didn't know if it was cancelled. I tried calling Glasgow Bus Station and waited around 15 minutes or more to get through, another 5 minutes for the person on the line to come back to tell us the bus should be arriving 'now', by which time - it had - albeit not in the exact stance it should have.  Fortunately I didn't have an appointment or necessary time for getting to Liverpool, so it wasn't too upsetting, but it was a bit disconcerting for other passengers, particularly as there was no-one, or any notifications to advise of the delay.  No apology either, just a comment from the friendly driver that it was an ""estimated"" time for the connection.  Nonsense!  😏🙄😊  Hasn't put me off using Megabus, they are still great value for money and the drivers were helpful and friendly.  The company should maybe have a look at letting folks know if there is going to be a significant delay and perhaps ensure a verbal apology is issued when the bus does arrive and maybe an explanation i.e. traffic or whatever, - it would go some way to ease frustrations.",16 June 2023

He came to my seat and told me to leave the coach in the middle of nowhere. If I was not happy with the way he treated me I should leave.He also took the food that I had purchased at the service station and kept it in the hold of which I obliged.When I was taking my food to the hold, we passed a young gentleman of Asian origin and the driver told me that he also shouted at him. It was as if he was trying to say, I shouted at him but he has not complained, why are you complaining?I responded back to him and told him that we were two completely different people.

So to further my disappointment we were left on an out dated, cramped, uncomfortable coach for 8hrs. Had usb ports that didn’t work, poor air conditioning, a toilet that had no toilet paper, no hand wash facilities or a sanitising station.

This was no fault of the driver who did really well in avoiding the closed section with his diversion. Coach back to Sheffield was on time despite amount of traffic getting to M1. The only issue I have is with other inconsiderate passengers. We booked our seats and reserved them. Despite reserved notes on seats others initially sat in them.

"Megabus Never Showed Up, Poor Customer ServiceI recently had the misfortune of booking a trip with Megabus, and I must say it was a complete disaster from start to finish. I had heard mixed reviews about the company, but I decided to give it a chance. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a decision I deeply regret.First and foremost, the most frustrating aspect of my experience was that the bus never showed up. I had meticulously planned my journey, relying on Megabus to get me to my destination on time. However, to my dismay, the bus failed to arrive at the designated pick-up point. I waited anxiously for 90 mins, hoping for a late arrival, but it never materialized. This left me with no other option but to scramble for an alternative mode of transportation.Desperate and pressed for time, I had to resort to taking the train, which was three times more expensive than the Megabus ticket. This unexpected expense put a significant dent in my budget, causing unnecessary financial strain. Moreover, due to the delay and the subsequent train journey, I arrived at my destination hours later than planned. As a result, I was extremely late to an important job commitment, which not only affected my professional reputation but also caused me considerable stress and anxiety.Frustrated with the entire ordeal, I reached out to Megabus to request a refund and compensation for the inconvenience caused. However, their response was shockingly disappointing. Instead of addressing my concerns and offering appropriate compensation, they only offered a refund for the cost of the ticket. This lack of understanding and consideration for the tremendous inconvenience and financial burden I experienced further tarnished my impression of the company.It is abundantly clear that Megabus is a terrible company with an appalling level of customer service. Their failure to fulfill their basic obligation of providing the promised transportation service is inexcusable. Furthermore, their reluctance to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions by offering only a partial refund demonstrates their disregard for customer satisfaction.Based on my disastrous experience with Megabus, I strongly advise everyone to avoid this company at all costs. There are numerous other transportation options available that prioritize customer service and reliability. Spare yourself the frustration, inconvenience, and financial loss by seeking alternative modes of travel that value their customers' time and well-being.",15 June 2023
"Double Change of Coaches on M22 London - Middlesbrough 18/06/2023We were asked to change coach in Northampton or so at about 2 AM in the middle of the night. At this process I lost the seat (33) that I had reserved at £2. To make matters worse, we were asked to change again to another Megabus Coach in Leeds at about 6 AM in the morning. We waited like 45 minutes to 50 minutes before that could be sorted out as neither the drivers of the new coach nor the new coach itself were found, The driver did his best to locate the new drivers who were now fishing for where the new coach was parked. It was so unprofessional and I was disgusted with the service. I am sure my £2 seat reservation money will be refunded plus a compensation for delays and disturbance caused during the journey. I am sure that was a definite departure from how Megabus operates!",19 June 2023

"Megabus has gone ‘downhill’When I arrived at Preston Bus Station at 7am, there was a coach waiting but this did not say ‘Megabus’ and it was not obviously a Megabus replacement-I had to ask. Also, the coach had at that point, broken down, although they managed to fix it. There was no working toilet on this replacement coach. On my return journey, again, it was a replacement bus which was an hour late getting back to Preston.",15 June 2023

"Bus did not turn up.Bus from Liverpool One to Glasgow Buchanan Bus Station did not turn up. We were in good time for 1:10 bus from Stand 6. No show and no staff to help. Could not contact MEGABUS either. Had to pay for new tickets to Edinburgh on a National Express coach. Very stressful, especially as we are both 72-years-old.Meaningless reply inviting me to contact “a member of the team.” Have now sent three emails as no one answers the phone. Have been told the bus turned up 75 mins late but I dispute this as we were there far longer than that before we bought new tickets with National Express. No sign of the megabus. No refund offered as a bus has to be 120 minutes late before a refund is given. Totally outrageous! Also told that i should have allowed 90 mins for transfer bus even although my ticket transfer was automatically generated at 15 mins.Moral of the story is: AVOID megabus if you want peace of mind to leave and arrive as scheduled. Do not expect anyone from the company to give a damn.",16 June 2023

However, in a city as big as this with plenty of routes and regular coaches. it is not acceptable to have a meeting-point comprising a small pavement area down a side street with no overhead cover, nor a board showing when coaches are due to arrive/if they are due to be late. (Coach was 50 minutes late with no updates at all).It had fewer facilities than an ordinary bus stop. The staff member looked like she didn't want to be there and had had enough by 9am, no doubt near the start of a shift. If it had rained, it would have been a thoroughly miserable experience.

Megabus journey best forgotten and never repeatedMegabus started late and arrived late.  I'm five foot six but when I found the one toilet half way through the journey of more than eight hours it was only by asking the driver and I was bent over to urinate a feat only possible since we were stationary. Perhaps for first timers he could announce the location at each pickup point. Then the smell was terrible throughout the coach for the second half of the journey. At the end of the trip I struggled to stand and I'd paid for front seat for more leg room.I was booked on a return trip but took the train instead. I won't be using this service again and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,11 June 2023

The trip from Bournemouth to London was delayed for 2 hours 5 minutes with NO communication throughout the waiting time nor apologies when the bus finally arrived.

Passengers were agitated and extremely uncomfortable - rain showers, station toilets had closed by 5pm etc. The bus eventually arrived at 7:45pm with no toilet paper, sanitizer, handwashing liquid nor water on board. There was no air conditioning on board, passengers were using hand fan.On a previous trip from Hull to London in April 2023, the toilet was a mess - dirty floor, no toilet paper and the hand basin had stagnant water.I am not only done with Mega Bus, I will ensure no-one within my sphere of influence use the company.Wunmi O.",17 June 2023

What is going on with MegaBus!!! The whole way through this experience we were being lied to and strung along. We then were told we'd need to wait for the next bus at 4.00pm which incidentally didn't show and leave until nearly 5.00pm!! And we nearly didn't make that being told we were not priority again as we were not booked on that bus which of course we weren't as our bus never showed!! No understanding or process for people left stranded when MegaBus cancels your bus. But they'll go out of their way not to officially cancel to avoid paying you a refund. We had both taken leave from work, having lost time and money which has been completely wasted, all I can say is I'll never use MegaBus again and advise you don't use either. The staff and company couldn't care less about people getting to their destinations and the company is atrocious only wanting to capatilize in every which way except for providing a bus service!!!

Then got a replacement coach 'back to London' which showed up late, then when we got on the coach, the driver told us that he only had 45mins left on the clock and wouldn't make it to london from where we were, so we had to get off at Nottingham and pay for another coach, a National Express one, that actually works, and is professional, and took us all the way back to London! DISGUSTING SERVICE! NEVER AGAIN!",05 June 2023
It was goodTrip to Leeds,02 June 2023
No show and no refundTurned up 40 mins early. Bus never showed even after 1.5 hours after the departure time. Ended getting the train back at more cost. Got hold of the customer services and they said they contacted “Airsym” and they said it departed on time which is impossible as I saw every bus come and go. Either Airsym are lying or they are. Don’t waste your time with these. Wish I saw the reviews first.Update. And as you can see by the pointless reply it’s obviously a trained policy to do no refunds what so ever. I’ll let my credit card get the money back,14 June 2023

Not comfortable,31 May 2023
"Horrible and disrespectful experienceFirst of all, we PAID for selected seats and we couldn't have them when the bus arrived because there were a lot of people waiting for the bus and no one respected anyone.  Talking about the bus, it came a really small bus, not the one expected with the amount of seats required to all the people waiting. The trip was long, it took 11 hours from Edinburgh to London and we couldn't recline the seats, so obviously our necks hurt a lot even now. We had to be separated with my boyfriend when we had paid seats, I truly believe it's unbelievable, so disrespectful because the driver said ""I'm just the driver, it's not my problem""... Many people had to travel more than uncomfortable and suffering because of the back and neck pain. My boyfriend is a tall person and he couldn't fit in the seat so now he has some issues in his legs, we're on vacation and we have to get our next tours cancelled because of your terrible service. Please, don't have any doubts that we're going to let everyone who is interested in travel with you, about this matter, we'll never take any service with you and we demand a compensation for this, like I said, we paid for selecting the seats and we never have them. I'll be waiting for your answer.Regards.",09 June 2023

"Extremely Dissatisfied with Mega Bus ServiceExtremely Dissatisfied with Mega Bus Baggage PolicyReview:I recently had an incredibly disappointing experience with Mega Bus service on 5th June 2023 when I am travelling from Newport to Heathrow Airport, primarily due to their unfair baggage policy. As a frequent traveller, I rely on efficient and cost-effective transportation options, and Mega Bus failed to meet my expectations in this regard.Before my trip, I had thoroughly reviewed Mega Bus's baggage policy, which clearly stated that carrying any extra luggage would incur a fee of £10. However, to my utter disbelief, when I boarded the bus, the driver insisted that I book an additional ticket to bring an extra bag with me. Essentially, I was being asked to pay for an extra seat just to accommodate my additional luggage.Being a single individual, this demand from the driver was both absurd and completely unacceptable. It felt like an unjust and deceptive way to extract more money from passengers who are simply trying to transport their belongings. Not only did this inconvenience me, but it also highlighted a significant flaw in Mega Bus's understanding and implementation of its policies.The lack of consistency between the officially stated policy and the driver's demands was highly frustrating. Mega Bus should ensure that their staff members are well-informed and trained to handle such situations without causing unnecessary inconvenience or financial burden to their passengers.As a result of this experience, I am left with a sense of deep dissatisfaction and will think twice before choosing Mega Bus for my future travels. Any transportation company must have clear and fair policies in place, as well as well-trained staff who can provide accurate information and uphold these policies consistently.I hope that Mega Bus takes customer feedback seriously and rectifies these issues promptly to provide more reliable and customer-centric service in the future.Rating: 1 out of 5 stars.",05 June 2023

There was also an unexpected bus change in Manchester but the driver's assistant kept everyone well informed and the coach to change on to was waiting for us which was appreciated. We were international travellers and didn't have phone access, so the only downside was that the coach didn't have internet to allow us to inform our family when we would arrive in Leeds.Even though our experience wasn't good due to the delay, we would recommend Megabus to anyone wishing to travel by coach.",30 May 2023

To make matters worse, we were locked on the bus for 40 minutes in the heat with no water. This was a scary experience, one that was dangerous and has left us scarred.TRAVEL WITH THESE INCOMPETENT AND UNSAFE PEOPLE AT YOUR PERIL",02 May 2023

"This was my first time booking with…This was my first time booking with mega bus, and my very last. I had booked a megabus from Manchester Airport at 09.55 to Heathrow Airport and was flying to Norway and so had a flight to catch. I arrived 10-15 early for this bus and the bus never turned up. I waited and waited and then it was too late to get a train, plus National express were full and had no vacancies. I had to beg a friend to drive me 4 hours to Heathrow Airport. This was a nightmare and I am very disappointed with your service and will never travel with Mega bus again.",30 May 2023

"Driver missed us, Megabus not interestedI wish I'd read these reviews first...  I booked an Oxford bus via Megabus from Heathrow.  It was supposed to use bus stop 10, but the only bus we saw drove straight past us to drop off passengers at stop 11 - so we assumed it was dropping off only.  After waiting another hour we finally realised that it must have been our bus.  The driver made no attempt to signal or call us over from the correct stop.Of couse Megabus are not interested.  I had to pay again to use another bus.  Avoid.",27 May 2023

"Bus delayed for 11 hoursI booked the Megabus service (operated by Prime Bus) from Brussels to London on 5 June. The bus should depart at 00:40am but it only appeared at 9am the next morning. I was left stranded out in the street in a foreign country for the whole night. The bus should reach London in the morning at 7:10am but only arrived at 6pm, a total delay of 11 hours. I called the customer service twice for help. Both the operator and driver were unfriendly and taunted me for making too many phone calls, disturbing their day. Driver explained, I took a 9 hour break, that's why you waited so long. I tried to catch up on sleep on this bus but the driver played loud music all the way to London.",05 June 2023
Megabus does not deserve any starMegabus does not deserve any star. The bus from Birmingham to Heathrow was more than 2 hours late. There was no explanation or apology on behalf of the company. The driver apologised becasue he was with us. But nothing came forth from the company. I got home at 11:30pm that night and I had to walk alone simply because Megabus chose not to address the situation. I was not even compensated with a refund. At least a partial refund would have helped so I could call a taxi rather than walking home alone that late in the night.,01 June 2023
Poor service on SundayThe service on Sunday for 11:59 trip was bad . The driver dropped  us in Bristol and asked us to get down when the bus taking us to Cardiff  and Swansea  hasn't come . And asked us to call customer care . We were out there in the cold till bus came to pick us,03 June 2023

"An uncomfortable journey for meThe problem was that the air conditioner didn’t work upstairs on a very hot day. I am 78 and have limited mobility but I hadn’t understood that I could book a seat downstairs from the website. So, I had to go up in the unreserved over heated section, then down when a seat was available, but then up again when the bus filled up at Manchester. It was a miserable experience. The staff didn’t seem to care and there was no apology for the lack of air con.  Windows should be able to be open so that if air con doesn’t function there is another option. Moreover the price on that day was raised because of the rail strike.",31 May 2023

Moments later an announcement was made and we pulled into a service station!We were disappointed with their lackluster approach and didn't appear as friendly as our previous crew.",04 June 2023
"Poor communicationPoor communication: I was going from Manchester to Glasgow. Bus was delayed by 1hour 15 mins. There was no communication and announcements about this.

"An absolute JOKE of a service.An absolute JOKE of a service.The Aircon was on full blast, felt like we were on the inside of a freezer, not to mention whenever someone went to the toilet the Aircon spread the smell over the entire bus.On the topic of the toilet there was no running water in the sink whatsoever, so I had to use hand sanitizer to wash my hands. Which is just disgusting.The bus hadn't been cleaned and was full of crumbs and dirty wrappers.The bus was overbooked so half the passengers had to get off at Edinburgh if they were going to Newcastle. Then we stopped at Newcastle anyways!Zero communication from the driver to passengers regarding reserved seating which lead to a verbal altercation with another passenger and myself.Never again megabus, never again, I'll fork out the extra money for a first class seat on a train next time.Tldr.If you want to sit in an ice cold tin can for 5 hours that stinks of feces with your knees pressed up against the next row choose Megabus.",02 June 2023

"No commentWell to begin I booked through megabus whom I went with last time & the trip was excellent however this time I travelled with linberg services much to my surprise. Not only wasn't I informed of this but the they were the opposite of megabus. Little comfort,little space & no legroom. Also the driver was arrogant towards me prior to departure. There was no greeting no introduction to the passengers something I thought was mandatory. The date was the 1st & the 3rd June. I wish to specify I have no problem travelling with megabus as this review as far as I'm concerned is about another bus company based in Sheffield. Why I booked with megabus but travelled with someone else I will never know.",01 June 2023

"MegaBus lies about coach being thereBooked the 3am coach back to London Victoria but it didn’t arrive on time, i waited with my friend and along with 6-8 other people at the South gate platform 6 for 30 minutes and it still did not come. This caused me to stay at Gatwick until 5:47am and having to sit inside on floor until the trains were running. I emailed them stating that we waited 30 minutes with other people but i got a response that “I have tracked this with our control team and can see that the coach arrived at Gatwick South terminal at 03:03am and then departed at 03:15am.”This got to be a joke because i was standing next to the MegaBus platform sign at 2:55am up until 3:30am. If you don’t want to refund, then just tell me straight up rather than indirectly call me a liar because i can garuntee that the CCTV will have videos of me and other people waiting in the freezing cold that day waiting for the coach and asking TFL staff whether it was comming or not but they said it’s best to speak with MegaBus stuff via call or email.Also, i tried tracking the coach online using the live tracking and i couldn’t see anything nor was there an update, so why arnt the people able to access whatever “tracking” your control team has. A joke of a company, first time using this as it was strikes that day, i don’t recommend it at all.",31 May 2023

Furthermore the sign on it said ""London Victoria Street"" though Heathrow is the terminus for that service.I had to go to National Express and do my journey to LHR with them.

Megabus 2 hours late on train strike dayMegabus coach was operating approxamatly 2 hours late and ny time i boarded and arrived at my destination i was 2 hoirs 40 minutes late. Megabus should allow stand time alomg the route and when the coach reaches its terminal before it turns around so should the service fall behind schedule it can catch up easier rather then run late throughout the entire journey. Aside from that megabus coach seats are really comfy and operate regular services accross the uk for a reasonable price,30 May 2023
"TerribleWithout any prior warning or announcement, the place where the passengers had to get on the bus was different from the Middlesbrough bus station. I also found out by accident. If I hadn't noticed, I would have missed the plane ticket and it had a lot of negative consequences for me. In addition to that, the driver was very rude evil and illogical in such a way that he did not consider the condition of the passengers in any way. He also drove very risky and in a hurry.

One lady had a taxi at her end already booked and if she couldn’t get another one, she could not get home.When it is busy, try altering the times of the coach so people aren’t hanging around for hours on end.

"Bad company!!!I am very upset that I bought a ticket from Aberdeen to London, but could not use it only because I was two minutes late and when the bus was standing, I knocked on the door, but no one answered me.  A man (representative) of the company shouted through the door to go to the next bus.  I confidently went to the Megabus information office and asked for the next flight!  The first thing that upset me was that the next bus left only the next day!!!  It was a shock for me!  But, the biggest shock for me was that they would not give me a new ticket for free!!!  I will have to pay for it!!!  This shock and I started to panic!  I had no place to stay in London, I had to leave urgently, I was going to celebrate my birthday ... but everything was ruined and the holiday was missed.  In addition, I got sick and herpes got out on my lip from stress.  I was shocked by such an attitude towards passengers!  I am a refugee from Ukraine, I was going to my host in Scotland and got into this situation.  Nobody wanted to listen to me and help me.  I had no money.  £45 is a lot of money to just pick up and throw in the trash!!!  In America, no one would ever do this to people!!!  They always give you a free ticket if you miss even the plane.  I demand that the representatives of the company contact me and return the money for the ticket!  Otherwise, I will never use your services again!!!  It was my first experience.  And tell all my friends to enjoy it!  I will also write a review on all sites, in FB, Instagram !!!  This is not the way to deal with people in whose country there is a war going on right now !!!  The whole world helps us, but not your company.  I will also demand moral compensation.  Because of you, I stayed at the station and caught a cold!!!  I ran into a lot of trouble.  And everything could end well if the driver just opened the door!!!",29 May 2023

"Hassle free, Well worth the moneyAbsolutley loved the coach trip. There were only 3 things I wasnt thrilled about.Going the coach was 15 minutes late neither here or there. But the driver who got off was rude, I realise he was stressed, as were the other members of staff who were also there to help, but he was rude.  i asked him where i was to sit as I couldn't remember and he gave me the wrong information. Which meant that in Oxford i was sat in someone elses seat. the Driver (who had swapped in Birmingham) who dealt with it was lovely, but the first driver had given someone else my seat. hence why I was in the wrong seat. And his driving was apauling. You could tell all he wanted to do was get to his last stop and ""get back to Sheffield"". He was a very impatient driver, using his horn quite a lot.But I got to my destination in one piece.On return, the coach was a bigger coach and full,. Lovely driver,  We got home fine and on time. My problem was the toilet. Boy it was horrible. And the reason it was horrible was the flush point wasn't visiable. I found it eventually but you could tell that people couldn't be bothered looking. There was no soap and the drier system didn't work. I don't like to use the toilets on coaches normally, but it was hot and i had drank a lot and so had everyone else. Maybe you could have a memeber of staff dedicated at each pck up to check the toilets are okay, at least once on a journey.But aprt from that i will be using the Mega bus again. For the money it was fantastic and I had no hastle with getting stuck in traffic, Cause I wasn't driving :)",29 May 2023

We noticed the legroom on this particular coach wasn’t as good as our last one but not sure if this is the difference between reserved seat and general seating? System wouldn’t allow me to reserve seats for this journey and I’m not sure why as the coach wasn’t full. Would still use again as we felt comfortable and safe.,03 June 2023

"Really poor bus serviceThe journey to Birmingham was fantastic bus arrived on time the driver was very helpful even got to birmingham a little earlier than expected. However the return journey not so seemless hence the 2 stars we were at the bus stop for 2pm the m38 our bus arrived at 2.15pm the driver check all our tickets and directed us on the bus we was sat for 45 minutes sweating as no engine was on we ended up getting off the bus to see what the delay was and only then did the driver inform us that the other driver who was going to driving us hadn't turned up and he didn't know what was happening. This went on for 2 hours then the bus driver who had originally brought the bus to the stop came up the stairs of the bus to inform us that a new bus was being sent and we would all have to transfer but it wouldn't be here for another 45 minutes then it was well over an hour until the new bus arrived, such bad service very unprofessional and it's safe to say I will not be using Mega bus again",02 June 2023

"Commendable service, schedule needs tweekingThe drivers and the coaches were superb.  As a passenger we were impressed, but as a travel professional it appears the schedules are not realistically achievable.  We travelled from the south coast to London & return during May (mid-week).  The motorways and roads were overcrowded and as a consequence our driver had to take an inconvenient 45 minute break mid-journey.  As a passenger this was inconvenient and must have been stressful for the driver.  It is a great service and excellent value for money but the scheduling needs to be addressed and made achievable and realistic.  I will use this service again but another similar occurrence would make me think twice.  I would prefer to pay a little more for a more efficient reliable service.  This review is not a winge but is intended as constructive feedback.",30 May 2023

Got to junction, police stopped coach from going further! Drivers contacted HO, meanwhile husband had done a long reroute journey to get to Lancaster Uni. Drivers then informed passengers the drop off would now be at Lancaster park and ride. Husband had to set off again from Uni to pick me up. Waste of diesel, waste of time. If drivers had acted on information given, new drop off point could have been arranged immediately after leaving Preston thus avoiding much confusion, time and effort by those collecting passengers! 1 hour 20minutes late.

I came to victoria afterwards and requested one driver of 9pm bus but that bus was full and he cant accomodate me. But driver of 10pm bus has fully denied to take me into his bus and forced me to bye another ticket. And I was helpless and bought another ticket (14-8135-020623-CM10N-1800-LON-CDF-/).Logically and factually, no where in this world happen like time at least a few countries I visited. If any seat of that bus is free, you can take you respective delayed passenger. Because, he or she already bought the ticket for the day. That driver could do that because at least 15 seats were available in the bus. So frustrating and monopoly attitude. May be driver is right, then again Its not a very healthy practice which fails consumer Rights.My analysis is, in some cases, Drivers show recist kind of attitude while they understand that they can handle him or her in his way.Anyway, I know Megabus authority will never take actions but again appreciate a reasonable action on this case.",01 June 2023

"Coach left early.This is my first and last time using megabus. I would recommend everyone avoid! We had a coach yesterday to London which turned up late. The whole drive was filled with constant breaking. Broken seats on the coach. Then today on our journey back from London we had a mad rush to get to the coach station and managed to get there a few minutes early, tickets don’t make it clear enough what number coach you are so looking at the signs trying to find our coach was, we went to the point only to see our coach leaving EARLY. spoke to a very rude Megabus staff member who was condescending and unhelpful. He said 5 people were missing from the coach yet it still left early. He then explained we could pay £10 extra but hours later and when his shift was finished but stated that’s only if there’s space or we could buy a full overpriced ticket. As we have children we had to pay £100 for a train home which in all fairness was a much better travel. No options for a refund. I will make sure to tell anyone I know to avoid.",04 June 2023

"Delays, poor tracking service, poor CS, poor bus stand(UPDATE 06-JUN-23): Since submitting this review, Megabus got back to me and apologized for the poor service that day. At their own initiative, they offered me a refund of my ticket. Consequently, I'm submitting this edit to my review and changed my rating from 1-star to 3-star. I still believe they should do a better job in providing tracking information about their coaches. It would go a long long way to improving customer satisfaction.I took the 2150 Megabus on 02-JUN-23 from Birmingham to London. This bus arrived at Brunel Street at around 2:45am at night, making it about 5 hours late.Lateness can happen in bus journeys but what's unacceptable is that their tracking service stopped tracking this particular coach after Goole. As a result, we stood in the cold for 6 hours not knowing when the bus would arrive. If we had accurate tracking information about the coach, we could've taken refuge at any place nearby such as New Street Station and just shown up maybe 15-30 minutes before the expected arrival time. We stood as we watched buses scheduled later than ours arrive and take their passengers. It made us think that our bus could arrive at any moment. Two other London-bound buses also arrived and headed off to London but there was no info about our bus. There were no changes to the tracking info after 9pm.Another unacceptable matter about their service is that they do not care to provide a phone number or a chat service through which we could get in touch to get accurate status info about our bus. All they gave is this email address but how can one realistically expect an email to be answered promptly?We even asked for help from the drivers of the other buses that arrived at Brunel Street. Some told us the bus was stuck in M6 and was on its way (although they said that without checking with anybody, so it was pure guesswork). Others didn't give a damn and just ignored our pleas for information. Only one driver was decent enough to call someone at Megabus and through him we learned that our bus ""had just left Newcastle"". That update contradicts what others said about the bus being stuck on the M6.If they had given us accurate tracking info, we could've taken care of ourselves and waited out the long delay.If they had given us a number to call to get information, we wouldn't have had to bother their drivers.If their drivers were more considerate of Megabus' customers, they would've taken only a couple of minutes of their precious time to help us out.If Megabus had bothered to put bus stands that are shielded from the weather, we could have withstood the cold wait better.Although nobody likes to be delayed, we could have tolerated the delay better had Megabus done a better job to keep us informed about the bus status.",02 June 2023
"Coach service from Reading (UK) to London Gatwick on time and positive experienceI took this service for the first time. My trip was from Reading to London Gatwick scheduled at 11.20pm by MegaBus Coach. The coach arrived from Birmingham in Reading on time and I got the destination according to their scheduling. It was a very positive experience. The negative evaluations from other travelers have not been occurred in my case. For sure, I will take again this service as a cheaper and convenient alternative than the railways also because I am fed up with continuous rail strikes and their service disruptions.",01 June 2023
"Dangerous driving, unrealiable and no communication- Unreliable: left London 1h30 behind schedule, arrived in Paris 3h late. Almost 1h delay on the way back and we arrived nearly 3hours behind schedule. Based on this trip, Megabus should add at least 1h30 to the scheduled travel time.-  No information and no way to get help: we had to stand by the gate/boarding board waiting for the bus. No information was provided either at the station or online. And no possibility going the toilet or getting food/drink as you don't know when the bus will turn up.-WORST OF ALL: POOR, DANGEROUS DRIVING: bus driver drove 5 hours or so nonstop from Dunkerque to Paris. Stopped briefly on the emergency lane to have a wee. Move back to change line on a toll in the motorway. In a traffic jam, use the exit lane to then push his way back into the traffic. It felt that he was under pressure to get to Paris quickly. In the same time, was the last bus driver back to the coach so passengers had to wait on the deck and we were among the last to leave. On the way back, there was an issue with the bus, the driver was stressed and had a massive argument with someone at the Paris bus station holding the queue to leave. Make me question the working conditions at Megabus which seems to putting pressure on drivers to keep up unrealistic schedules and value more profit than safety. Sadly, I wouldn't be surprised if a Megabus coach is involved in a deadly collision with a high number of casualties in the future.- Not that important compare to the rest but the bus wasn't comfortable and had limited leg space and I  have been on much more comfortable coaches before.Glad I made it back alive but will defo not go back on a Megabus coach again and would advise anyone to stay clear from them.",31 May 2023
"Mental and physical tortureI usually don't leave reviews, but this experience was exceptionally terrible. I am truly in disbelief. I took a 12-hour coach trip from Edinburgh to London, and it turned out to be the worst experience of my life.Firstly, the seat had no cushioning and felt as hard as a rock. Despite not being a tall man, my legs were constantly pressed against the seat, causing me pain throughout the entire journey. Additionally, the seat was fixed at a 90-degree angle with no option to adjust it, making it nearly impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep. To make matters worse, there was a radiator blasting heat at my feet while the air conditioning blew cold air on my head, leaving my lower half boiling and my upper half freezing.The coach was scheduled to depart at 10 PM, but the grumpy bus drivers refused to let anyone on until the exact departure time, resulting in a delay of half an hour. Moreover, when I purchased the ticket, it indicated a bus transfer with only a 10-minute window to catch my connecting bus from Glasgow to London, despite coming from Edinburgh. Fortunately, I managed to get on an earlier coach by sheer luck because I arrived at the station early and thought it was worth a try.At one point during the journey, they allowed too many people to board the coach due to the delay I mentioned earlier. As a result, when we stopped in Manchester, there was a chaotic crowd trying to get on the bus, and the bus driver rudely screamed at people who were showing their tickets.To add to my woes, I lost my wallet towards the end of the trip, but the bus driver showed no concern and simply told me to get off the bus. Based on this experience, I not only refuse to recommend this service, but I believe this company should be shut down completely.",01 June 2023

I received an email from you that the money for the canceled trip will be refunded to me within 5-10 days, so it's been 2 weeks and the money is still not there.

No apologies from driver.

The Bournemouth to London 17:40 might as well be the 18:40 because that’s when it’ll turn up (if you’re lucky and I genuinely not exaggerating). Consistently. Every day. 1 hour late. You think you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but they end up proving you right every time and show you why you shouldn’t trust them. And they excuse their own poor behaviour by not offering refunds for significant delays or any delays of the sort. Truly a horrible company to ride with.

"No point in reserving seats if you're not allowed to sit in themWe prebooked the 11 am from Bristol to London on 25 May, where we were heading for the Chelsea Flower Show. The bus left on time and got us to London in 3 hours. What annoyed me on booking I'd reserved seats 3 and 4. Two reserve notices were placed on the seats I assumed were for us, but as soon as we sat down the driver barked at us we couldn't sit there because that's where he kept his high-vis jacket! We ended up sitting on the seats behind, completely squashed. What's the point in having reserved seating if you can't use it and what would we have done if someone had booked those seats??When we swapped drivers at the services about two hours into the journey, the second driver was on his mobile phone all the way into London.Coming back, again the bus was on time and we were able to sit in our reserved seats, again 3 and 4. Lots more leg room this time and a more comfortable ride, but it had been a hot day, so the aircon was on - too high. I was freezing and I couldn't adjust it.Can't comment about the toilets because we didn't use them.

And refuse to pick me up from the coach station claiming j had an extra luggage, I tried to pay for the extra luggage but was unable to and the driver drove off without carrying me,  leaving me in distress. I texted the online customer team. And he said my money is not refundable but I was there and he refused to carry me. Now am told I can't get my money back and yet couldn't get the service I paid for. Am so  disappointed and sad.",16 May 2023

WOSRT customer experience I have ever…WOSRT customer experience I have ever encountered. Little updates given when bus didn’t arrive. Told that they would try and get us on the next bus over an hour later if they had space and if not the next bus 2 hours later or the next again which is 3 hours later. All buses are pre booked and it’s a bank holiday weekend. There is no way there would have been space for an entire packed bus to move to the next. To also then put other passengers on a delay as they wouldn’t be able to get on their paid for bus either. Nobody would wait on a “possibly” resolution to an already paid for trip. Declaring this as a delay rather than a cancellation when it’s not the same bus is absolutely shocking. People with connecting travel left with no help and will have missed journeys. No refund offered and little done for supporting customers. Absolutely shocking and disgusting behaviour. Would not recommend to anyone.,27 May 2023
"Smooth experienceThe driver - he was really friendly, very organised and really helpful. We were surprised by the level of care shown - the offers of help and the attention to all the travellers. The bus was clean and the journey was on time and we will definitely use again",19 May 2023
Shockingly bad customer serviceBooked a coach well in advance then received an email from them the day before my booking to say its been cancelled.  I spent 20 minutes trying to speak to them on the phone but no one bothered to answer. Finally got a response from them via facebook and they lied saying they notified me of the cancellation 2 weeks ago - I asked for proof of this but they refused and said that they can cancel bookings whenever they want.,26 May 2023

"Not recommend10hrs ride and not a single stop for a cigarete or strech is ridiculous not even for 1 min but drivers change took 15 min while on services with doors for passengers remaining locked. Not gonna even mention lack of space while sitting. Well done, first and last time with you.EDIT: If you dont provide 'comfort' breaks as you named it, but driver made a stop and went for a cigarette then something here doesnt add up, I just simply cannot see a reason why its not possible for everyone if the bus is already stopped on services 10sec walk from petrol station, also space for legs would be greatly appriciated and as far as usually thats not a big problem during 3-4 hrs travel this particular time it would be less painfull to simply stand whole time. Not gonna mention 75 people using only on board toilet, if you dont care to make 5 min break during 10hrs ride, smell was simply disgusting. I probably expect too much which is bare minimum while travelling with anyone else. Good luck I just dont need that, there is plenty of other services and 10£ more for the ticket to be treat like a person not stock and avoid you is something I advise to anyone thinking about using your service  👍",26 May 2023

And then of course the driver continued their tirade of tardiness which resulted in completely missing the original connection I had to catch for my final stop.I arrive to Leeds station (FINALLY) to find a way to my final stop, Manchester. A Megabus going to Manchester was parked and lo and behold I was told 'I was lucky' it's running late. Why was it running late? Good question... They couldn't find the driver and it took maybe another hour to 'find the driver'. What in the world that means I'm still sat here trying to figure out.There couldn't be a more incompetent business. And the icing on the cake, every one of the staff members I encountered were so damn rude and unhelpful. So good job Megabus, you're doing well.",25 May 2023

"Was my first time on Megabus from Hull…Was my first time on Megabus from Hull to Birmingham. I reserved my seat but noticed alot people jumped on seats then moved if they got challenged... whenever we reached a destination, the driver was very quiet at announcing the destination you could hardly hear him. Those with headphones definitely would not have heard...my seat was no.15 extra leg room unfortunately when ever the over head doors were opened to get access to the luggage I couldn't see because it completely blocked my window and I was anxious nobody took my luggage. Driver doesn't keep watch who takes what. He's either busy booking the next lot in or sat down...taps in toilet didn't work, bottle of handwash was left out but useless when there's no water. Should have left some sanitizer out instead.Return journey was so different infact brilliant! A driver called Paul, at every destination or pick up he announced loud + clearly, politely reminded people to collect their luggage, seat belts on, keep phones and music low, reminding us we don't all have the same music taste, please flush the toilet, remain seated until he has stopped. About tapping their feet hard it vibrates downstairs .He even told a couple off to make sure their child to remain seated and seat belts on at all times ( child was a nightmare) he thanked us using Megabus + hope to see us again. He was basically abit like those air hostesses but very professional, very informative. I needed someone like him to explain to me what's what on the trip and keep everyone in check.I saved £50 by going on the Megabus instead of by train. The money saved, I treat me and my son( from uni) to a lovely lunch.Happy days.Ps yes it was a 6hr journey, outbound coach was very tatty, I paid for extra leg room so I was ok, lots of stops just abit anxious because driver wasn't communicating, yes air con was on, just be organised, take a jacket it is a 6hr trip! Take snacks/water. Return journey everything was excellent, we were delayed but I'm not complaining because you knew it was 6hr trip so give a little slack and take the trains if don't have any patience.",14 May 2023

"London to Leeds @ 10:00pmLondon to Leeds - the bus left on time, the driver was friendly and helpful.There was wireless charging available (and ports for wired charging), tray tables, a toilet, decent storage and the bus arrived in Leeds on time.this would have been a better review, however, the bus was extremely warm, to the point of uncomfortable. There is air vents above the seats, however these had the power of an asthmatic mouse, meaning there was no respite.The seats aren't exactly uncomfortable, but not the best either. Some of the armrests were broken, which was slightly annoying",20 May 2023

"DREADFULPaid extra for seats with a table which I would say is an exaggeration to say the least, I would call it a ledge!! Expected more leg room with a table,BUT NO. Charging points not working, toilets very dirty with no water to wash hands and I expect that's why there was no facility to dry your hands. No toilet roll (not that I needed it due to the state of the toilets). Lack of information from drivers via destinations and diversions and safety information.  Whilst I accept that coach is the cheapest form of travel,(albeit you are not the cheapest) there is a minimum standard that you should be adhering to mainly safety and hygiene you were a million miles away from achieving the bare minimum. Given my dreadful review I would be more than happy to discuss on a personal basis.",10 May 2023
"Coaches arrived on timeCoaches arrived on time, drivers very helpful.Only gave 4 out of 5 as on journey back to Hull from Manchester airport - air conditioning on - but VERY COLD, also unfortunately through no fault of his own - driver had to break unexpectantly  because of another vehicle driving in front of him - and he used some bad language, understandable - but was loud enough for everyone to hear.",21 May 2023

"Don’t pay extra to book seats you don’t get themWe book specific seats at a table on the bus to be told, there are no seat numbers on the buses we were on so we ended up sitting in a cramped seat with no table as there was already people sitting in the seats we had booked. Driver said to contact Megabus regarding the problem. I hope we do not have the same issues on our return journey on the 5th July",21 May 2023
"THE WORST TRAVEL COMPANY!THE WORST TRAVEL COMPANY!! DO NOT USE!!!If there was a -10, I would definitely give this mark. Made a booking for a trip from London to Edinburgh. On the was to EDI everything was fine. On the way back, a different bus service was put in place, and we were left without ANY leg room between seats ( even though we paid for it)!I am 1.58cm (which means I barely have legs), and my knees literally touched the seat in front of me. No charges working, a delay of 2h ( because driver decided to take 2 breaks :one of 30min, and one of 1h - even though we were NOT informed when booking was made).All in all, the WORST travel company you could use. NEVER AGAIN!!! Please choose National Express and DO NOT SPEND MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY, as you do not know what you get!!!",20 May 2023

Economy travel- expect economy service!Cheap way to travel- but saving money comes at a price! I use megabus a lot - twice a week and service varies. Usually late- sometimes by half an hour -sometimes an hour and a half. Toilets are a squeeze to use (recommend you squidge sideways) and take tissues as toilet paper often runs out or gets wet. Sometimes the flush doesn’t work and that can be a precarious situation- especially after ten people have used it!If you need more reliable and a reasonably on time service then I would consider national express- however- it will cost you quote a bit more.Megabus is cheap and relatively OK - fairly comfortable seats -fine if you need economy.,19 May 2023
"Toilet stankToilet stank, staff were honestly so rude.",18 May 2023
No refund and expensive it's expensive to change your ticketThe booking was easy but when I needed to change my ticket or cancel for a refund about an hour after booking I discovered that:1. You cannot get a refund if you cancel your ticket;2. To change your ticket you will pay over £3 fees even if the new trip is cheaper than the price of your initial ticket.3. Any balance after you changed your ticket to a cheaper one is lost.Those are not good policies at all.,16 May 2023
90 minutes late and missed connectionOur first coach was 90 minutes late. We eventually got to Preston and our bus to Glasgow had left.

"This was the worst coach/traveling…This was the worst coach/traveling experience I’ve ever had.Firstly the coach arrived half an hour late, which made out arrival time later, we was meant to set off from Manchester at 7:30 am to London arrive for 1:30pm. Unfortunately we didn’t arrive to London until 5 hours later so 5pm almost 6pm.The bus driver was being extremely rude to the fellow passengers and had been taking wrong turns missing stops and stoping at a truck stop and went to get himself food white we was already behind schedule. He then miss the reading stop twice and passengers who was getting off had to tell him he missed the stop. We got to reading at 3:30pm when we was supposed to get there for 11am.We then had one more stop in Heathrow which he took the long way to get there, and then ended up switching drivers. As we was switching drivers he was laughing at the passengers complaining that we are taking long. We have now been on the coach for about 8-9 hours with no food. Kids on the bus and elderly people.Because of this experience it had caused me to miss my meeting I had arranged in London so I’ve had to change it to another day, and I’ve traveled from Manchester.I am still extremely annoyed at this situation as it has caused a lot of problems for my entire day.",18 May 2023
"GreatGreat, no issues",16 May 2023
"Normally FineI am normally very comfortable.And I think having clean toilets and plug sockets are a huge plus.But, the coach is always late for pick up from Heathrow because the coach is always nearly always coming from London Victoria.  Megabus don’t allow themselves enough time on the schedule to get there for the scheduled time.The coach is often too hot - drivers will put the air flow on full blast but also leave the radiators on. Meaning the person in the window seat roasts because it’s right next to their leg.I commute between Manchester and Heathrow - but it’s more expensive to go to Heathrow that it is to London, even though you’re getting off earlier.It would be great if you could introduce a feature to make last minute ticket changes on the day. I’d be happy to pay a fee to be able to change it on the day. That way if my flight arrives on time I can bring my ticket forward if there’s availability.",17 May 2023
"Helpful Service?Having used Megabus for years I’d never experienced being refused onto a bus because I was too early. The driver said he had to leave at 10.40 & if I was booked for 11am then I’d have to wait.The upsetting thing was that he wouldn’t check our names against his list or check with HQ. As suspected, the time had been changed but neither I nor the the other passengers had received e mails. We were stranded as there was no other bus arriving, but thankfully the other passenger negotiated a taxi paid for by Megabus to Manchester. Such an unnecessary stressful experience for us & expense for the firm - if only the Driver had been more thoughtful & spent a little more time checking things out.",19 May 2023
"Excellent service both to and from…Excellent service both to and from London. Coaches on time. On both journeys though, the toilets were broken.

"Very Unhappy Customer experienceVery Unhappy Customer experience - Pink-haired Megabus customer service rep on street at Birmingham Brunel Street departure stop earlier today announced that the bus would be delayed for 1hr due to a traffic accident. This meant I would miss my connecting bus to Inverness at Glasgow. Asked for advice from this rep - he was clearly uninterested in helping and told me to go to the info desk at Buchanan bus station & there I would ‘probably’ get a taxi as a replacement. Seemed to be suggesting that this was my problem to solve. Not comfortable with trusting this tenuous advice or maybe ending up without transport late at night as a lone woman - even if I’d got a taxi as a replacement, the prospect of a long late night trip with an unknown taxi company in remote, phone signal-less areas of the Highlands was unappealing, as was the thought of arriving back at my local bus station in the small hours. Ended up checking back into the hotel I’d just left and booked my journey home on the train for tomorrow. All at a large cost to myself. I rang Megabus customer service, and told that the street rep’s advice was incorrect, as the info desk at Buchanan bus station would be shut at the time I would arrive. Should have been advised by Birmingham rep to to do online chat asap on Megabus website to prearrange suitable onward travel prior to arriving at Glasgow. Given vouchers to value of my missed journey today by friendly, respectful, and very apologetic phone advisor. I would absolutely recommend choosing any alternative possible to Megabus - the extra cost is worth it. Megabus auto-bot standard reply…I am definitely fully deterred from ever travelling with you again. Folks, please be aware that you may be given incorrect/unsafe advice by on-street Megabus reps who don’t know the basics of their job. And Mr Pink Hair - probably best not to patronisingly peer down your nose at a paying customer old enough to be your mum whilst saying “RTA stands for road traffic accident” in a condescending manner. I do believe you are in the wrong job for your personality type.Edit - having read through other Megabus reviews I’m totally shocked at what I’m seeing - please, if you experience anything like drivers on their phone whilst driving/speeding/unwanted sexual attention from Megabus employees you MUST report this to the Police. Try to get videos/names/witnesses and report any crimes when it is safe to do so.",18 May 2023

I told them to help me out on how to pay for extra luggage but no one was ready to listen to me, they were ready to leave me behind, I ask them if I am to cancel my ticket and get on the next bus can I pay for extra luggage for my things,they said no I can only travel with one bag . I want to know how Megabus has one bag policy. How do u expect someone to travel without her luggage... And no one was ever ready to listen to my plea, is either I go with them with one bag or leave my things behind.

I asked the driver to turn the heating on on the coach but it didn’t really change anything.  It’s a shame because the service is ideal for me and I commute a lot but feeling so cold on the coach for such a long time isn’t pleasant at all!  We are now in May!!!!

MegaPooThe seat was so small that the twin seat divider was up my bum  crack for most of the whole journey. The seat cushion was totally useless and flat making my back bad. The toilet was so small that I could only squeeze through the tiny door sideways while the bus was stationary. The slushy toilet was full and stank horrendous. The bus was delayed due to missing/forgetting a passenger and we had to wait for them to catch up via another bus.,05 May 2023

"Horrific experience don't use them !!!A joke from start to finish ! They tell you to be there in plenty of time I think 15/ 20 minutes, got to Leeds bus station it was closed, very difficult to understand where you have to go. I then seen a megabus stop and asked the driver , however it was heading to london, however he was helpful and said this is correct bus stop.I arrived at 01.50am on Saturday 15th, a few more people started to filter and all asked me is this the area for megabus to Edinburgh,  yes it it is I replied. Well 02.20 passed by , then 02.30, then 02.40 and we are all panicking,  they all asking me are you 100% sure I said yes bus driver going to London told me ! We were freezing,  eventually at 02.48 a megabus arrives , by this time we were all frozen solid , were lucky to climb aboard. Driver did not apologise for delay,  I showed him my ticket said I've booked seat 79. Oh dont worry this isn't the right size bus you just grab a seat anywhere , you'll change again in Newcastle!!!! I said are you joking we are already changing at Edinburgh ! He just shrugged. Climbed aboard to the most disgusting,  filthiest bus I've ever seen in my life !!! White bags full of rubbish hanging fron most seats, eventually I found a seat and one of the gentlemen who came on at the same time sat opposite. There were empty burger King bags and wrappers everywhere,  the bus was freezing , no heating on despite I heard someone ask and got a reply its ON, I was frozen to the bone. My plan was to fall asleep until Edinburgh however now I didn't dare in case I missed the change again in Newcastle!  Got on the bus in Newcastle,  still cold . Everyone was complaining.  It was the worst journey I've ever had in my life ! As soon as we arrived to Edinburgh I had to go get a hot drink immediately I was so cold. We were then told different bus to dundee look for a gold colour one ! No help with baggage had to put it on ourselves, and on arrival to dundee had to help myself to get my baggage again.  I would never ever travel with this company again in my life. I had to have a hot bath immediately due to being so cold. I've told everyone I know and put on my social media page. I work for the largest UK holiday companies and I've never experienced anything like this !!! AVOID snd pay extra for a decent company!!!",15 April 2023

The pole with the Megabus sign was rusting; unlike other service providers'. We feared there would be no coach although we had booked online.

First time using the Megabus service.We were shown to our reserved seats by the driver.Very comfortable with plenty of room. A very good service at an excellent price. Journey was 4 hours from Birmingham to Victoria Coach Station in London. A little long because we called at Reading and Heathrow Airport. Less than 10 minutes wait at each so no problems. It was our first time using the Megabus and we found it most enjoyable.,03 May 2023

uncomfortable and thirstyThe comfort of the seats from London to Glasgow was not very good and there were no stops with an option to stop and buy a drink meaning I was very dehydrated for the journey and when I did ask at 1 of the station stops I was told I could chance it but once the bus was loaded with the new passengers it would leave with or without me. The staff on the bus did take the opportunity  at each stop to smoke a cigarette while loading the new passengers and luggage in full view of them.,04 May 2023

"I had a good and bad experience with…I had a good and bad experience with Mega bus.The coach going to London was over 1 hour late and when it arrived it was a white coach without the Mega bus logo or colour blue, which wasn’t a problem but I found the staff rude and patronising.  The on board toilet didn’t work and was locked. So passengers had to ask the driver/staff several times before the coach was stopped in order for people to be able to go to the toilet.  I am a 55 year old intelligent woman, however I had a rude member of staff telling me not to go too far!  I’m not a child! I just wanted to use a toilet!The journey back to Birmingham a few days later was better.  The coach was early and the toilet on board worked and was clean.I used this mode of transport because it was cheaper than the train and due to spending a lot of money on my Post Malone ticket and London hotel, the cheap fair helped keep costs down so overall very good value for money.  You seem to get the best priced fares if you book well in advance like I did.  The two tickets only cost £11:30.  I spent more money on a coffee and sandwich in London than that.I acknowledge your reply, however from reading other reviews, your cut and paste reply means nothing if you aren’t actually going to take action and improve your services.",03 May 2023

A few of them had their legs sprawled in the aisle & we had to climb over them, as they were so drunk they wouldn’t move. A lot of them were playing loud music & using vile language & it absolutely stank on the coach.I spoke to the driver & complained about the journey, but he didn’t seem to care at all, he just said that it’s always like this on a Friday & Saturday night & he dreads it!! I emailed a complaint on Saturday morning, but they haven’t even bothered to respond.

The area as nothing around. We were not only afraid of all of this, but specially because we have two dogs at home alone. We had to get back to work the next morning and we didn't even knew if the bus was still coming. I had to ask another companys driver for information and he called Megabus company which informed him that the bus would arrive around 23:50 and just arrived at 00:10!!!!The bus showed up 45min later! The driver even laughed at my face because I was about to go to the train station and pay to go back to London.  The perfect company to travel.As an answer, I got that they only refound (which I didn't even asked for it) after 120 minutes delay.

Breeding ground for bugsThe last few times I have used your bus service between Inverness and Edinburgh I have had a bad experience. The buses are often so overheated and when I ask the driver to turn the heating down they don’t! The bus I am currently on also doesn’t have any soap or hand sanitizer. I feel it is a total illness breeding place. I am really not sure I will travel by bus again in the near future,28 April 2023

"The worst tripHi,It was the worst trip of my life.It was an insult and disrespect to the passengers in general and to us in particular, which we found on this trip.How can a large company like yours start moving the bus before the passengers sit in their specified places?We had reserved specific seats, including seat number 4 at the front of the bus, and we paid an additional amount of 4 pounds in order to reserve it in our name.Unfortunately, when we got on the bus, we did not find numbers on the seats, and all the front seats were occupied by other passengers.The bus driver closed the bus door and I moved and we did not find my seat.And the bus driver started shouting that every passenger should sit in his place.So I went down to the driver and asked her where is seat number 4. Please tell me where it is, as there are no numbers on the seats.So the driver stopped the bus and yelled at me and said: Let's get off the bus.I told her I want my seat to sit on.Her cry increased greatlyWhich embarrassed me very much. So I retreated and sat down in an empty seat, which I found in front of me.Question: Where is the company representative or station manager so that passengers can sit in their places and then allow the bus to move?This is an error on the part of the company.Secondly, why don't you train your employees to deal well with the public?This is not an appropriate transaction for your company and damages your reputation.I hope you take this problem seriously.We demand that the mistreatment of the female driver and the company be dealt with firmly.Thank you.",10 April 2023

It is just a money looting company.Once you book a ticket anything may happen before you travel time, so they don't even allow to amend the booking if you need to travel on the next bus on the same day. I wonder which consumer law is allowing this sh** T&Cs they say when you request them change for same day. The cruel thing is they allow to book one hour before but not allow to amend.",26 April 2023

"Poor!Coach from Bournemouth to London was 35 minutes late. When I asked driver why he said that due to driving hours restrictions he had not been able to start when he should have. Nobody waiting for the coach was aware of this and I was wondering if the service had been cancelled. When we got under way the driver drove too fast and erratically through the roadworks before Winchester. We were then told that despite leaving 35 minutes late we would be taking a 5 minute break at Fleet services for anyone needing a toilet break because we were ""running early""! When we stopped I realised that there was a sign on the door of the toilet on board the coach saying it was out of order. We then started off again and called into Heathrow as scheduled. After leaving Heathrow we were heading along the M4 into London when unexpectedly we turned into Heston services without warning where the driver informed us that he would be leaving the coach there and another driver taking his place. We arrived at Victoria about 25 minutes late. The return journey was on time and went smoothly but the outward journey was shoddy, shambolic and unprofessional (and some of the driving borderline dangerous).

Having remembered that megabus was…Having remembered that megabus  was actually not bad in the 2014 era and knowing a journey of 10 hours  would screw me up (planes are indeed 1.5 hours but the amount of walking required is not and option and I refused to use a wheelchair until it’s an inevitably. Anyway at  Victoria a white bus pulled up and announced it was the replacement. The driver refused to let me use the disabled seat because that’s where his jacket and lunch box are and that there wasn’t any difference anyway.. which is Tosh. It’s a disabled space for a reason. he advises to use the two tables which were already booked and paid extra for by others- on that journey up I had several dislocations in my hip and wrists -painful and the toilet looked like it was permanently locked. The driver was being a martyr about driving since 9 the night before which made me feel very unsafe.The journey back bus was nicer but it stank and I nicknamed it the vengabus because the two lads driving were having their own mini rave -which is sweet actually and they were both very kind when I was in pain. It’s just a shame the whole bus smelled like 18 Tom cats had been having a pissing contest . Never again… there a new bus company. If I need to do that journey again I’ll use them at least they have their own fleet,10 April 2023

"Be careful no breaks or service stopsMy journey was London to Newcastle upon Tyne (11:59-9:15) . Considering the duration of the journey any rational thinking human would assume this journey would have a service stop or break. Guess what, they don't have any allocated time for breaks or rest stops. As I started to feel sick mid journey and asked the driver if he'll give me 2 mins (at one of the bus stop: at Mansfield 4:35) so that I can buy something to drink, the driver said"" sorry we are already running 5 minutes late"". The rest of the journey was really hard for me as I had nothing to drink and was already feeling sick( my water 700ml was already finished). Eventually, I was feeling so thirsty that I had to get off at york at 6:10 just to get a drink and then took a train to Newcastle. I came from a third world country and still would choose this journey as the worst journey of my life.Few key points-1- its not just me, I noticed few other restless passengers going back and forth during stoppage.2- the driver isn't the one to blame, I blame the megabus company because they could arrange a 10 minute stop for a break for their customers.3- a 10 minute break is not a wild concept. Not having a break in long journey like this is very difficult.4- in the US megabus journeys longer 5 hours have breaks and i am sure that's not causing them to go broke.5- I can assure all other unsatisfied  passengers and megabus I will personally advice my close ones to avoid megabus and I will definitely give it 1 star review on all platforms.",25 April 2023
"No Megabus STOP in CambridgeThis was my first experience of traveling with Megabus in the UK  and unfortunately I can't call it positive.MINUSES: they gave an approximate place of departure, i.e.  near the entrance to Jesus College.  The ticket indicated that it would be a dedicated bus stop and did not indicate that the intercity bus would load passengers with luggage at the city bus stop.  The bus that arrived did not have the Megabus logo.  I found this bus and got my jorney only because a group of people dispersed along the street with luggage approached the bus.  2.

On the return trip the loo was already well used, you could smell it as you passed by. I had to use it once. It was as bad as I thought it would be. Again no hand dryer, but there was more toilet paper.The seat in front had old chewing gum pressed into the material just where the hand holder is, so I kept accidentally touching it.The trip cost far less than the train, and there were no connections to worry about.

"Shocking Service-no star review - never againWhen we arrived to catch our coach to return home, I first enquired at customer service and I was told to take the bus to Bristol university even though I was supposed to take the Bristol coach. Luckily I figured it out.Your driver got to Victoria Coach station on time but first had his break where we could watch him eat and nk for 15 minutes, resulting in us departing late into peak hour traffic. Once on the coach, he and his assistant proceeded to eat and chat to one another as well as make very personal phone calls using handsfree. They were also playing their favourite songs at a very loud volume. We had no charging ports either - thankfully we had a power bank because we actually needed to make further arrangements to get to Bristol airport which is not something I would have thought I needed to do.When we got to Bond Street 1 hour later than scheduled there was NO bus waiting to take us to the airport. Despite me booking this. I asked the driver what to do now and he said he wasn't sure and it wasn't his fault because the traffic was bad. I was still left destitute with my 11 year old son after 22H00 at night in a place we are not familiar with. He told me to phone megabus but my wife had tried earlier but they (as you know) close at 18H00.My wife then had to order us an uber to get us safely to the airport. This was not in our budget.This is horrendous service, if we book something and we are not there I can appreciate there is nothing we can do. Stagecoach and Megabus are one company and need to communicate to one another so that the customer is not left to fend for themselves.How will I be compensated for this ?Also to add I contacted your customer service and after saying it was a complaint and telling the whole story told me to put it in an email.

It happened twice now that I was told “we don’t do numbers today”, so everyone could sit anywhere. People book, and pay extra, for a seat of their choice. This should always be respected . Why paying extra and choose a seat of your choice if you end up sitting elsewhere, and someone else on your paid and reserved seat?

"Didn't meet expectationsDecided to take a Megabus due to industrial action on the rail network.  In hindsight I could have taken the 25 minute train journey from Reading to London as the industrial action was cancelled, but as I had already booked and tickets are non refundable I stuck with my initial plan.  The positive was myself and family got from A to B safely.  And now the not so good.  Arrived in good time at the bus stop only to find that the Megabus from Manchester was already running 50 minutes late (which I accept is at the mercy of the road network on any given day).  Eagerly anticipating a big branded blue and yellow Megabus coach, what came round the corner was instead a mega disappointment.  A non descript white coach with very little to identify it as a Megabus.  The crew jumped off in their very minimal uniform to the point we had to double check it was a Megabus.  The crew saw this as an opportunity to have a cigarette break whereas I was hoping that they might have been helpful, customer focused and assist adding our luggage into what was already a very full hold.  After a struggle we got there ourselves.Final disappointment was the reserved seating that we had booked and PAID for as we were travelling with young children was non existent.  The crew were uninterested and to avoid a mutiny onboard we had to find the odd remaining seats scattered around the coach.  The crew told us that they were sub contracted to run the service hence no branding and they do not operate reserved seating, which I found strange considering that Megabus were happy to take the money at the time of booking.With delay, journey time and further delays on route we finally arrived over 3 hours later.  The whole experience didn’t really live up to expectation and so will not hurry back to use Meagbus again.",01 April 2023

"The duration of the trip was 6 hours 30…The duration of the trip was 6 hours 30 minutes from Warrington to London, but it took us 8 hours, lots of stops & drivers seems doesn’t care, taking their time.  On the way back, no one mentioned us that the toilet is not working, took over 8 hours again (should be 6 & 30 minutes). The worst trip in my life EVER!!! Will not recommend to anyone 😡",10 April 2023
"Coach service from Manchester to…Coach service from Manchester to Newcastle at 17:20 didn't arrive until 19:50 due to a traffic incident earlier in the journey which I don't argue or blame but what followed next was an absolute joke.The service eventually left at 20:00pm but due to further delays and logistics because the driver couldn't finish the route due to his tachograph reading I didn't get into Newcastle until 02:30am.Repeated failings by Megabus on this stage of the Journey. There was supposed to be a relief bus to pick us up from York, this wasn't at the bus stop as advised, waited in York for a further 30minutes. The coach then continued on to Leeming Bar services to meet the relief bus (the one that should have been in York) but once again it wasn't waiting for us as we were told. This meant a further 45 minute wait. The relief bus then eventually turned up (it wasn't a megabus branded one) the two coaches then swapped passengers & luggage to continue the journey onwards.This journey was quite frankly an embarrassment from Megabus. Why you thought using the same driver which arrived into Manchester to take us on our way to Newcastle knowing full well he would be unable to finish the journey speaks volumes on the blatant lack of planning and foresight.This pushed the E.T A. Back ever further, needlessly. The relief buses should have been at the drop off waiting for us. There was no excuse for this. Everyone's travel plans after they disembarked the coach were now not possible because of the times people would have arrived I.e. for me, there are no buses running at half 2 in the morning, meaning I had to spend more money on a taxi.In response to this it feels reasonable to have 1. a full refund for the journey which should have arrived into Newcastle at approximately 9pm not half 2 the following morning and 2. To be reimbursed for my taxi fare home.",04 April 2023

"I thought I had booked reservation seat…I thought I had booked a reserved seat for my journey back. I was asked by a man, to see tickets. He approved and I was just about to get on, but realised I haven’t been given a seat number. I then went back to the man, ‘what seat number am I?’ and he replied ‘oh you’ve reserved’ I said yes (I thought I had), he made me wait last, until he saw everyones tickets. Finally, he looked and said ‘no you haven’t otherwise it would be there on the ticket’, I perhaps gave a puzzled facial expression he explained further. Upon explaining, I realised I must have done in error. Accepting this in the moment, I thought I might not have clicked it properly, and will have to re-look when onboard. I went to get onboard. Then the man shouted erupt ‘make sure you don’t get on to the bus and wet everything with your umbrella.’ I then shook the umbrella as I didn’t want to annoy the man further. As I was getting in he said I could sit in the front, this was my interpretation. I smiled, thinking I definitely need to check my ticket. Therefore, I headed to the front, seeing an empty seat, then all of a sudden I heard full on shouting, aggressive voice, I was thinking what is going on down the entrance door to the bus. I was stunned as I looked down to see the man peering up, waving his hands about, looking at me and shouting towards me. I thought he was going to come up at me. This was the moment where I realised I was being verbally assaulted. He aggressively said ‘I told you not there and you go sit there, you don’t have a ticket those are for reserved people who have paid’, in front of the whole bus, I was in total shock. I was absolutely humiliated and felt very little. I tried my best to let the man know it was unintentional. I tried to get a word in, where I could, I gently and calmly said I’m sorry I obviously didn’t interpret what you said. But he just shook his head and did not accept this, thinking I pulled a fast one he carried on. I never meant to go against the man at all, I don’t like to make up a scene which was what ended up happening with all his commotion and I guess my misunderstanding but that’s not a way to behave. Because of the rudeness and aggression, towards an NHS worker going back home, I will not be getting on to a mega bus again. Your made to feel like dirt. Because I was a lone women, I sat far away right at the back to get away from his presence. It’s where I became nauseous and nearly sick. In general I make sure my seats are at the front for that very reason. It was not a pleasant journey back to home, sorry unable to recommend. It’s not acceptable to treat a human this way no matter what background or colour you are.",14 April 2023

"Process of travelAlthough the process of booking etc was easy, of getting people onto the bus needs a bit of work.  The issues I witness on my return journey with regards to passengers queuing in two different lines and then being treated like children by a member of the megabus staff.  The bus was going to be full but everyone there obviously had booked a seat so the fact that the member of staff could have taken one from each line would’ve saved a lot of  stress and avoided the raised voices (only from the member of staff may I add, the passengers she was shouting at never reacted).  Also. it would be an idea to ensure that the seat numbers are visible to those who have booked specific seats.  I have never been able to find my correct seat without asking people to move.",15 April 2023

If I could no stars I wouldIf I could no stars I would. Using megabus has not been pleasant. Using this service has been a horrible experience and a nightmare to travel. I travel between Cambridge and Birmingham and not matter what time I catch the coach it’s always over an hour late and it’s tiring because why am I having to stand in the rain and cold waiting for it to arrive and on the app or website there’s never any update so I don’t even know if it will even show.I want to get a refund for the trip I prebook but as it states mega bus doesn’t give refunds which I think you’d lose a lot of money if you did due to the lack of professionalism. After the trip that’s pre booked I don’t think I’ll be using megabus as it’s a cheap disappointment!!Below I have stated only one date but I have had many bad experiences,06 April 2023

Severely Delayed CoachCoach was late to arrive and when it did get in the drivers faffed around for ages meaning we were already 20mins late when we departed.

Whilst at Newcastle-under-Lyme the coach had issues and we had to wait a further 15mins for this to be sorted meaning I was over 1hr delayed.

"Terrible customer service rep at Victoria Coach StationI was sitting waiting to board the 1.30 bus from London Victoria to Leeds. I could see it and the doors were shut so I waited for boarding only to then watch the bus drive off. I asked a member of staff if that was the Leeds bus and was told yes… no one called for passengers to board so I had now missed my bus. I was told I had to pay £10 to transfer my ticket to the next bus at 3pm. I was advised to go to the customer service desk to seek help. The member of staff there was incredibly rude to me and had no customer service training at all. I asked if I could speak to the manager and he was argumentative and said I didn’t hear them calling for boarding, wanted to know if I was on the phone and then very rudely pulled the shutter down in my face. When he returned, I asked for his name and he refused to give it to me. He also asked me if I was on the phone while I was talking to him - I don’t know why that is any of his business! He also asked who told me to come to the customer service desk and when I pointed out the other staff member who did, he angrily told me that person does not work for them! He was working on the customer service desk at Victoria Coach Station at 1.30pm on Saturday 15th April. This member of staff is in desperate need of re-training and learn how to talk to people. The fact he refused to give me his name tells me that he is aware of his lack of customer service skills. I did eventually speak to the manager, Martin, who did help me transfer my ticket to the next bus. The whole experience was very upsetting and stressful. I will not use Megabus again.",15 April 2023

On the way back to London started this awkward experience. The bus driver was very rude. It started with the driver insisting we place our luggage on the bus(under the storage for large bags) ourselves. He didn't even touch at least one among 5 suitcases of the 10 passengers. The rest of the passengers were having their first trip to the UK. He was judgemental and started lecturing about what not to do on the bus. Despite the fact the bus seats not very clean already. All the way the driver yells at fellow drivers and sometimes had sudden brakes on. When we had a snack pack bought in Tesco.

Late bus and confused drop offThe bus arrived 1 hour late from Leeds at 10.10 on 1st April. By the time it reached destination in Southampton it was nearly 3 and a half hours late. 2010 arrival as opposed to scheduled time of 1645. Worst of all was that at the last minute the driver altered the drop off point in Southampton so that family who were meeting me had to trek across the city to find me. Both drop off points were inconvenient as there is no easy parking for someone to wait if collecting someone.,31 March 2023

Full bus with cramped seating, everyone absolutely dripping with sweat, driver was asked to please turn on some kind of air or turn off the radiators by 4 different passengers throughout the journey but the bus had some issue(???) causing the overheating.Also had issues with the booking of tickets as there was an error on the website leading us to buy an additional seat and was told no refunds are issued.

"Unnecessary and avoidable delaysOn one of our routes from London to Glasgow. Though we arrived at Edinburgh 15mins later than scheduled but the bus stayed on there at Edinburgh for almost 30mins and when driver came back to coach and was asked, he said he needed to use the toilet! Now, using the toilet is not a bad thing but courtesy demands that passengers be informed why they were being delayed at a stop when all those who wanted to stop at Edinburgh had all left the bus. We barely made the next connecting bus from Glasgow. We were just 3mins before the said coach would have departed. This was a trip I booked 1hr 10mins apart! The stress and anxiety of hopping off and on another coach without time we had given ourselves to move on was uncalled for simply because a driver needed to use the restroom!",06 April 2023

Never againBus was late for an hour an 40 minutes and no information has been given so everyone had to wait without knowing whether it’ll come. We called but number they’ve added on the tickets is not recognised so no support was available! Tracker device in the bus was not working too! And they left us on Leeds!! Waited almost 3 hours for a taxi while the stations was full of taxis. They said it had to be arranged by megabus headquarters so we couldn’t take a random one. Half of us was tired of waiting and went to the train. And they was able to find a taxi for 4 people surprisingly after most was gone. No one contacted us to apologise or refund.

IntransigentMaybe 1 star is a bit harsh but as I was unable to take the trip I can't really give the trip a score but as I was not permitted to either a refund or a date change I think the 1 star is merited.I run a hospitality business and it's been a fact of life for two years now that people's plans may have to change at short notice due to illness amongst otyher things. We take the hit when this happens in the hope that the customer rebooks with us at another date.Megabus should learn from this too.

"No show stressfulBooked megabus from Poole to Heathrow well in advance. Arrived 8am half an hour before 8:30am departure. By 9am bus stilled hadn’t arrived, myself and one other passenger tried the tracking, which gave no information. Both of us tired to ring, no one answered. National Express arrived and as it was now approaching 9:30am they kindly offered to take us to Bournemouth bus station. As I was worried about getting to Heathrow I brought a ticket with National Express to insure that I arrived in time for my flight. National Express staff were so helpful. Approx 15-20 min after arriving at Bournemouth megabus arrived. Explanation on not showing up at Poole was due to accident ( which no one else seemed to know about) I asked why we were not contacted to inform us ( Megan bus have our contact info they could of sent a text or answered there phone) response shrug of the shoulders. So yes I travelled with megabus to Heathrow. Very stressful morning and additional cost of £36 for the extra ticket to National Express as back up.On my return from Heathrow I was yet again stressed after a 10 hour flight wondering if megabus would turn up for the return to Poole. Thankfully megabus turned up on time.  I will not use Megabus again, customer service is nonexistent, tracking QR code doesn’t work. With all the technology we use, a text to inform you if the bus is running late or a problem has occurred would of been expected, instead of just being abandoned. So 1 star for getting me home.",28 March 2023
"Awful serviceThree friends and I travelled from Glasgow to Manchester using Megabus. When we were due to depart we were told the bus was over booked. About 20 passengers were then transferred to a much older McLeans bus with a huge 4 to 5 feet crack on the windscreen. This older bus was very cramped compared to the newer megabus and had no services like wi-fi or USB ports. When I complained to Megabus I got the usual 'it's in our terms and conditions"" and a blanket refusal to compensate with little or very limited reasoning.

Even the driver didn't inform we would have s change. He had said we would have a short break there. After a while, he said we would be going on with another coach. On my return, same day, from Heathrow to Swansea, while the departure from Heathrow bus station was 04.55 pm, the bus arrived to the bus station at 05.25 pm. İn Cardiff, we had another change, which was not stated on the ticket. After changing the bus, we waited almost half an hour. Then the bus went somewhere (that I thought we had set off to Swansea eventually) but the bus returned to place where we had change (opposite to Cardiff castle). Then we waited some  maybe 15minutes or more. After picking up the passengers coming from another bus, we set off to Swansea in the end! While expecting to be in Swansea at 09.15pm, we arrived at 10.30.Really disappointed with a long journey. İf you are planning changes or delays, you need to state it while booking.

I reached Shudehill interchange at 1:30 am but it was completely closed in such a freezing cold night. So i stood outside at Stand NN. I confirmed the departure place from other passengers too. So almost 3 hrs waiting. The bus didn't came and google maps was showing the bus has already taken passengers from stop NN and has gone. Surprise !Finally half hour after 4:10 the bus came. It went directly to Shude hill interchange, none of the passengers were there bcz all of them were standing at Stop NN. So the driver took the empty bus from Shudehill interchange directly on the main road and he went away after seeing all the passengers were at stop NN, Surprise ! Driver didn't stop for any of the ""Valued Megabus "" customers.. Surprise !  So for the whole freezing night i stood on my foot waiting for the mega bus and then my ticket was wasted, Surprise !I booked another ticket at 7:10 am to middlesbrough and finally i got the bus.

I’m a single Mum & I think the whole service lacks customer focus. All I can say is, if you’re relying on a bus service to get you to an airport to catch a flight, it’s best not to use this service, due to the fact they can even arrive up to 2hrs late and this is within their T’s @ C’s.

Single female travelling alone to…Single female travelling alone to London. I chose mega bus due to the train strikes as I wanted to attend a course. To keep cost down I decided to take an early morning mega bus 02:25am. I parked my car and headed off to wait for the bus. I don’t like been late so I arrived early. It was a cold wet morning. Due to the time the indoor waiting was closed. The time started ticking 30mins went by and no show from the mega bus. I then got talking to another young lady who was also waiting for the same coach. I tried to track the coach with nothing coming up at all. She tried the online chat but it was only working hours. 40-50mins still waiting a Mega bus pulled up. But unluckily for us it was the one for Edinburgh also running late. The driver did try and help us but again the tracking system wasn’t working.More passengers were arriving for the next London coach to leave at 03:20 to this we both decided to book onto this bus as we didn’t want to be late for our course and she had an appointment.This cost more due to late notice booking but we agreed it was the best option at that time.We then had a txt to say this bus service was running late.At this point the 02:25 pulled into the station. The driver apologised for it been late and said we would arrive over 1 hour late to London but it was still in time for both of us. We both boarded the coach and off we went.I was really annoyed that we had no way of knowing what was happening.I had lost money and it wasn’t the nicest experience waiting in an open space in the middle of the night.Return journey from London. It was a normal coach as I boarded I looked for my reserve seat. Another passenger said don’t worry just sit in any. I had paid extra online for this service. I sat down started getting settle when a family of 4 with 2 very young children boarded and said I needed to move as he had reserve seats I explained that I had too but everyone sat in any seat.His reply I have 2 children as a mum myself I was willing to move but another passenger wasn’t and stayed put.

"No Mercy / Poor Customer ServiceI was two hours on my commute to the Victoria Coach Station in London to catch my bus to Bristol via Megabus. I booked it because it was the most affordable price for off-peak travelers such as myself, a student who studying abroad and needs to keep on a budget. The train I was taking from Mill Hill Station to Victoria Coach Station stopped on the tracks mid-way to West Hampstead because there was a broken-down train infront of it. I waited over an hour. I arrived 1 minute after the train had left and immediately went to the ticket booth and provided an example of the situation I was in that was out of my control. The sales clerk said I was required to pay 10 pounds more and I refused to pay this as it over more than double the price together with what I had previously paid. I said that I was going to go try another way of heading to Bristol. That was another story. However, I wish that Megabus can have a QR code infront of their ticket booth for customer like my self could have settled with paying the same price again for the next bus. This would be an offer to help customer arrive to their destination with a reasonable price and arrangements for the next available bus. This will mean that customer who are in panic mood do not experience unfair and disheartening moments with any clerk at the front desk. Such events can lead to mortality with no intention of causing harm. I wish for an environment in that we can share compassion, profit, and respect each other no matter what the circumstance may be. I received very poor customer service and wish something was there to support me in a place of vulnerability.",30 March 2023

There was no any update so we had to call the hotline but it wasn't available as it was mid night. However we contacted out of hours services and got to know bus will be delayed about an hour. (Supposed to be there 00:25) There were more than 10 people waiting for the bus, then one of them also called again as it didn't come even afer an hour.Me and my wife had to go to work next morning and because of this we had to go to work straightaway.I wouldn't recommend megabus unless they improve their service in future.",30 March 2023

"Displeasure in your serviceDear Sir/Ma,Letter of ComplaintI, Bukunmi Victoria Fajinmi, am one of your loyal customers. I booked with this reference number AG DOKKY for my family, my son(4 years old), and my husband to travel with your coach M15 on 2nd April 2023 from Huddersfield to Reading.This mail is to express my displeasure with the kind of service they received. My point of grievance are listed below;1. Coach M15 did not arrive before the planned time of 12:40 pm on 2nd April 2023.2. When it arrived, they were not informed of the coach's condition or notify them of the reason for lateness.3. The coach had to discontinue the journey somewhere between Huddersfield and Manchester and passengers had to wait for another coach heading for Liverpool, which they joined down to Manchester station.4. At Manchester station, they were squeezed in on another Coach to Birmingham at around 3:30 pm and arrived at your bus stop some minutes before 6:00 pm where it was not well planned regarding which coach is to convey them from Birmingham to Reading and when the coach will arrive. You can imagine the kind of stress a 4-year-old was subjected to.5. After the intervention of your coach driver, Don, who helped to put calls across to your Coach Control to explain their unpleasant situation, a taxi was arranged to take them along with other passengers heading for Heathrow.6. At about 8:30 pm, the taxi driver dropped and abandoned them at Salisbury gas station, Calcot, RG31 7SA 14 minutes drive away from the right place which is Megabus bus stop at Reading railway station RG1 8BT. My husband complained but the taxi driver claimed he was following instructions to drop them there.This kind of treatment is not right. They ought to travel between 12:40 and 17:50 but later arrived at 20:30 late in the night with a 4-year-old, a very scary experience for him in the chilling cold of the night. That experience for them is traumatizing. This needs to be compensated and an apology needs to be made for the unfair treatment.I await your response on this matter.",04 February 2023

The coach was comfortable and clean, there were usb charging points.Having done the same journey with National Express, I prefer NX as they use bus stations rather than a stop at the roadside in major cities, which is better if it's cold or raining. I'd might well use Megabus again if the price was less than NX.

Was not told which bus from Edinburgh to Aberdeen and when I asked from 3 different customer advisors was told incorrect information. Megabus does not seem to drive to Aberdeen and I had to find a company called CityLinks who did this.  Too many seats upstairs on the bus which meant a steep walk up steps which is not suited to asthmatics such as myself.  Seats are also much too close together and I am only 5'2"" tall.  Lady next to me kept her large bag on her lap which also spread over onto my lap so couldn't move the whole journey.

"This is the worst experience ever…This is the worst experience travelling ever. Booked a ticket for my fiancé at 21:35 March 30th going from Manchester to Sunderland with connection in Leeds. He stood there waiting since 21:00, the bus did not show up. More than an hour later a bus with another company logo shows up, going to Leeds. He shows the ticket to the driver and the driver says it’s the wrong bus so he gets off. He waits another hour and a megabus going to Birmingham arrives. The driver is friendly and makes a few phone calls. Turns out, the non-megabus bus was a replacement and my fiancé should have taken that, so that driver misinformed him making him get off the bus. My fiancé now had to wait for the next bus to Leeds which leaves 23:35, it arrives in Manchester approximately 20 minutes late. “And then we’ll take it from there” customer service says. When in Leeds my fiancé calls megabus again but gets told that it’s all his fault and he has to wait for the next bus at 5:30. As I’m writing this now he is in Leeds trying to catch the bus going to Newcastle instead. It was supposed to leave 02:25 but is 90 minutes late. Now it’s almost 04:00 and hopefully the bus will arrive soon. I asked megabus office to send him a taxi since it was the driver’s lack of any knowledge that led to this. But all I got was a “sincere“ apology over and over.",30 March 2023
"a ridiculous ordeal over £152 and not 1 star because the customer service replied to me.Here is what happened and what could be improved:1. Firstly, the e-ticket DOES NOT have SERVICE NAME/NUMBER on it.For non-verbal or partly non-verbal people who are waiting at a crowded bus stop, contrary to a bus station with screens listing departures, this can get very problematic. That is part of my issue.Add M-number-of-bus onto the ticket. That is a small IT fix which will make your company less ableist towards your customers.2. Secondly, booking/re-booking phoneline has a charge per minute. This stopped me from rebooking my ticket, as my phone plan only includes minutes, not credit. I did not have £10 to my name to charge my phone at the time (that is a minimal amount I can pay to have in my account). This had me spend a night stuck in North London without any personal funds.Lastly, now for the main part here's my experience summary…•Bus for 23:55 on 26/03/2023•Arrived at FINCHELY ROAD, stop CL (by main road stop, not a bus station) at 23:50•Bus has not arrived for 5 minutes and since it was late and this was the last bus I got stressed, worried and a bit panicky that maybe it is stopping somewhere else. Then, at 0:00 I made a mistake, got confused and started jogging along the street being a National Express bus also Leicester bound•I got to FL stand within the next 2 minutes and once I realised I just made a mistake I started coming back and CALLED the Megabus contact line – my call started at 0:02•I was on the line until 0:00 and before the end of the call the operator called the main control room and checked the status of the bus. The person told me IT IS STILL TO COME•Message I got from the customer support along with zero support: “The coach arrived at the stop 00:00:42 and left at 00:07:11.”•Yes, precise to the second, but on a call I was literally told before 0:08 that it is STILL TO COME•Later I was just cold in London with no money.Will be using services of alternative companies from now on.",26 March 2023

I was especially impressed with the young driver Ben who did the pick up leaving Bristol at 17.05pm Saturday 25/03/23, on return to Victoria.His manner and communication was very Good, esp for a young guy. Start of journey he apologised announcing we would be arriving later than scheduled as the M4 was closed between Heathrow and London.  Thus he was navigating tight side roads  for a good few miles with several pretty hairy turns in comparatively unknown streets not ideal for the size of bus. Ben took it all in his stride, kept communicating well, and made very Good time so we were only marginally delayed, a lot less than had been predicted.  Kudos to Ben, he made a difficult job seem easy, which it wasn't in the dark, and pretty heavy rain on unknown terrain. Impressed!",25 March 2023

"My last experience with Megabus staff…My last experience with Megabus staff was a terrible one. I have never been treated like that in my life. Firstly, we are five family traveling to Bristol from Aberdeen. Our first tickets numbers was 52/56-3327-140323-CM9-0725-ABE-BIR-/63/67-7868-130323-M36-1850-BIR-BRIWe supposed to travel on the 14th of March but I became very sick with high fever that I was thinking it was Covid-19 until I was tested negative. Immediately, in that midnight, I wrote Megabus customer service was I was passing through and I was on fit to travel on the 14th my email was responded to in the morning on the 14th that if we still have up to 24hours before our traveling date,I can change our tickets. I wrote back to plead that we were not having up to 24hours again but I would appreciate it if they could help me change the tickets into redemption codes that would enable us to us it for another booking. My email was not answered until the tickets expired and I was told sorry that the tickets could not be used again. We became stranded and our house rent would be expired on the 15th. We called on our friends and family to help us with money to make another booking when I was better. We booked another tickets for five people from the same Aberdeen to Bristol on the 14th to travel on the 25th, after the booking was completed,I mistakenly deleted the receipt and I emailed Megabus to please help me retrieve the tickets, I was told that the booking was not in their computer. My brother also called, the person who answered the call pretended as if he didn't understand what my brother was asking him for he later cut off the phone. We tried all we could do but the tickets was later retrieved by us. Our trip time was 7.25am on the 15th, it was 8.36am I received an email from Megabus that my tickets have been retrieved and it was only ticket from Birmingham to Bristol that was sent to me when knowing fully well that the tickets have been expired. How on earth a ticket booked from you can't be retrieved that very day it was booked. This was a very bad experience I had with you. I have promised that I am going to report my experience with you to the Ombudsman. Another terrible experience at Aberdeen bus station. The workers were so unkind to us. They complained about out luggage, that we cannot travel with all our loads that even if they allowed us, London driver would not accept our luggage. We pleaded that we have called someone that would be coming to take back the remaining luggage by 9am. They shouted at us that our luggage would be trashed if we leave them till 9am. Thank God for my brother who we could reach on phone that morning that just left his home to come and look for us at the bus station. He was the one who rescued us from the hands of the cruel staff. The London driver they claimed to be wicked was very friendly and helpful to us.  They helped us to load and unload our luggage. Please, I will like to have a refund of my first tickets. I said to the staff that day that this will be my last day of traveling with Megabus.Thank you,Helen Okolegba",15 March 2023
"I had no real issuesI had no real issues. Someone was in my reserved seat but that got rectified at the next stop.One small recommendation perhaps?

The experience coming back was terrible.The experience coming back was atrocious. Standing at 3.30am waiting alone in Manchester for a bus which should have come at 2.50am with the most ignorant driver ever. His attitude was disgusting towards everyone who asked him a question and he lied to me about the connecting bus in Glasgow saying we wouldn’t miss as it was every half hour when in fact we had to wait 2 hours when we got to Glasgow and the bus we missed was just pulling out and we could’ve caught it if he had just messaged ahead and asked to wait 10mins which is what happened with the lovely drive we had from Inverness to Glasgow on the journey down.,19 March 2023

When I arrived there in Harry to catch the bus I realised that I actually booked  by mistake  my return to Manchester to be on the same day that arrived In London at 2.30pm. I was so frustrated by the mistake I made and by my financially difficult situation as I had to buy another ticket. I didn't know what to do but the megabus agent, a woman,  reassured me and said to me kindly:""don't worry, we understand your situation and will get you into the next bus to Manchester at 3.00pm.""  My tears came running because I didn't expect such a considerate treatment which relieved me from a miserable situation.I am so grateful to that woman and to megabus.Thank you",21 March 2023

"So awful avoid if you canI have never had a 100% pleasant experience with mega bus. If they were much cheaper i'd maybe let it slide but their prices aren't that much better then national express most of the time.Their buses are usually dirty and old, plugs never work and the toilets are terrible. I've never got on a mega bus with an fully working bathroom the flush or tap are usually broken. One time I had an 8 hour coach ride with no stop for a toilet break and the toilet flush didn't work and neither did the tap meaning the toilet had filled with everyone elses urine  but there was no other option to use the bathroom. Another time someone had thrown up and it hadnt been cleaned and it made the coach smell like vomit.Another time with mega bus I had to wait for 3 and a half hours for their driver to change over. And if its not a hygiene issue its an issue with the bus driver who tend to be pretty rude even if your polite to them. They also break traffic rules I've seen them cut people off and run red lights a couple of times. The only reason I'd ever get a mega bus is if there is no other option they are so awful please avoid if you can.",01 January 2023

"Lack of communicationOn my outbound journey, from Aberdeen. The 07.25 bus to Glasgow was running late by almost half an hour. No one communicated with the passengers until someone asked what the problem was. This only came about when a later bus was called. When staff were asked what happened to the earlier bus we were told it had left. Which was impossible as everone waiting had been there at least 20 minutes before the bus was due to leave. It transpired there had been a problem with the bus and it did eventually arrive. From there everything went as planned. On return journey from Manchester to Glasgow again the bus was running late by over 2 hrs. We were eventually informed that the bus was going to be delayed due to circumstances outwith bus companies control. Passengers travelling to glasgow were transferred onto a later bus which also ended up running an hour late. I am pleased to say that the staff member I spoke to regarding my connection bus was very helpful and assured me that if i missed my connection bus they would make sure I got to my destination. Even if it was by another mode of transport. All went to plan once the later bus arrived.  Where i understand that things happen. It shouldnt take passengers having to ask whats happening before we are informed of any issues. Other than these issues the journey in itself was fine and as comfortable as a long distance journey on a bus can be,   although sometimes the buses are too warm.",05 March 2023

They weren’t notified of any delays. After waiting for 2 hours without knowing if the bus is even coming, I booked a train ticket. As I was leaving the station I saw the bus pull up and so I had to cancel the train and lose money there as well.

Inadequate and insufficient information about route and delays her the Information Board at…Neither the Information Board at Heathrow Coach terminal nor the Coach Tracking feature on your App gave any information about the huge delay to the coach on 15 March. I accept that the delay was out of your control due to traffic congestion due to London Transport and the Rail strike. But you could at least have given up to date information on your App or at the Coach station. National Coaches was. Had I known there would be a delay of over an hour (in fact it was 2.5 hours) I could have found a warmer and more pleasant place to wait back in the airport terminal.I acknowledge that the driver was very apologetic about the delay but we needed INFORMATION!Secondly you do not give accurate routing information either on the Information Board or on the Coach. The electronic signs just said that the coach was calling at Bournemouth University and Poole. It did not mention Bournemouth travel terminal.

On both the outward and return journeys the buses arrived on time and the drivers were all very cheerful and courteous. You do need to factor in the fact that the services may not be running at the most ideal times in some cases but they are clean and comfortable and for us we had the added bonus of no changes, so once our luggage was loaded that was it till we got there !

"Give to National Express more £5  but don’t book this companyI was going to London for travelling to the airport but I missed my flight because of Megabus. I came to the bus stop 30 minutes ago for the departure and while I was waiting for the bus it wasn’t even writing Megabus anywhere and there were no logo of Megabus and also it was writing going to Newcastle or something like this city. That’s why I didn’t think that was my bus but a couple of hours later when I asked another bus driver he said that it was the bus I am waiting for. I was shocked and really disappointed. I asked them to get on the bus because there were still a lot of space but the said that I need to get a new ticket for the next bus unfortunately I didn’t have time to get the new ticket. The bus driver was really rude and said that’s the our policy I cannot accept you. But the reason of the missing your bus is because of your company Megabus. I’ve already come on time but I am a victim of your unprofessional service. Even I tried to call customer service at 4 am but I learned that they were not working at midnight. Customer service, bus drivers and bus logos were terrible. I want my money back. This is not my fault, this is your fault Megabus.!",11 February 2023

"pre-paid tickets but no seats on the dayMy friend and I had tickets for the Scotland v Ireland match in Murrayfield. I had pre paid tickets from Kinross to Edinburgh for the 11:20. On arrival at the bus stop the bus driver stated that there were only 6 seats left (there were 15/ 20 waiting). We were told another bus was on the way but how did we know if the same problem would occur.Fortunately for us a kind sole had decided to drive to Edinburgh and we were offered a lift.I complained to Megabus and their excuse was""Due to the rugby being on in Edinburgh, this can cause our coaches to become very busy and I am sorry that you were not allow to travel on the coach with your pre-booked ticket.""Well what a surprise, demand for travel tickets will be high when there is a main event on in Edinburgh. Who'd have thought it.!!!This is not the first time this has happened to me at Kinross and I understand the same problem happened on Saturday 18 March for rugby fans going to see the Scotland v Italy match.My reservations were confirmed by email and the confirmation email states ""This reservation entitles you to a seat on the trip you selected""I  found their excuse astonishing.It doesn't take much forethought to work out that if a rugby international is taking place at Murrayfield then all forms of transportation to Edinburgh will be busy, including Megabus coaches.Megabus is in the business of moving passengers from A to B. They know when there are major events taking place and part of your service should be to make allowances for busier times as your coaches will be in demand at these times.Megabus must have known how many customers had booked seats from each stop and to where. You should have ensured those customers actually get the seats they've booked.Clearly, Megabus must oversell tickets and/ or allow people to get on coaches without pre-booked seats. This is not good enough it reflects badly on Megabus's planning ability and does not represent a good service or reasonable customer care.Please don't make your passengers wonder if they are actually going to get on a bus when they've pre-booked seats.It is stressful to the customer, can ruin a planned day out and above all is totally unnecessary.",12 March 2023
Refund PolicyWatch out people! Ridiculous policy that they do not give you a refund when the delay is less than 120 minutes! Which does not make sense when you need to go to an airport because it actually means that you need to arrive at the airport 4 hours (2 hours for the flight and 2 hours to be compliant with their policy)  before your departure.

"Horrible customer service, delayed journey with no explanationMy return journey with Megabus was so disappointing. I didn't receive my seat reservation, no apology or explanation why. I asked the driver where seat 5 was and he said ""it's cool it's cool just sit anywhere"". There was no welcome announcement and no information provided by the driver at any point. I still have no clue if there was a toilet onboard. An hour into the journey we stopped at a service station where we sat for 5mins before the drive then stood up and told us we needed to wait for a new driver which took 25mins.  We then stopped at another service station where the driver shouted down the bus we had strictly 10mins and had to be back on asap as he would leave without people if need be. Everyone was back within 10mins. But we were sat there for over HALF AN HOUR and the only person not on the bus was the driver. I have no clue what he was doing or why we were stuck there so long. Again, no announcements, no apologies and no explanations. We eventually got to Manchester 40mins late. Traffic was fine, the delay was solely down to the driver.  5 hours is a long time to sit on a bus and unnecessary delays like this are unacceptable.  To be clear - the traffic was clear so this was not extenuating circumstances, this was down to their driver. I contacted customer services and received a copy and pasted response telling me that drivers need to take breaks for health and safety reasons. I told them I understand this, but breaks should be incorporated into their schedules. They had no explanation as to why their driver didn't communicate with us or why he held us on the bus for 20mins at a service station while he took his ""break"". They also confirmed that they don't stick to schedules?! They then tried to blame the traffic but as I say - traffic was fine! I also had to ask twice for my seat refund as this request was initially ignored. Don't book with them as you will arrive late for absolutely no reason, receive no apology or updates from your driver, and will receive a scripted response from customer services making up excuses.",05 March 2023

"Don’t leave your bag in the hold, someone will steal itTo begin, I take full responsibility for leaving my rucksack in the holdon 13/3:23 bus from Southampton to MCR/Shudehill, which continued to Newcastle, I reported the loss within 30 minutes of leaving the bus. I had many responses from Megabus but my Blue Rucksack was not foundSo some ‘sxxx’ has my bag, 2 skirts, 2tops, swimming costume as I was planning to take 3yr old grandson swimming, makeup bag but most importantly my medications which I desperately needed that night, I had to go to A&E to replace otherwise I would have had to be admitted into hospital.The problem, trust. Other people had suitcases in the hold, but there are no security checks, so many stops, so if a passenger points to to a bag the driver just hands it over!!!!who knows my bag could have been taken before MCR!So if you have a suitcase take it onboard!! I thought even though my bag was relatively small it was difficult for me to carry it up the stairs.But IF I travel with Megabus again I will take ALL my bags on board regardless of the inconvenience to myself or othersTo MEGABUS, is there no way that when passengers book online the passenger with a bag can download a flight boarding type label and tie to their bag?Then the driver would have a ‘Bar Code Reader’ that matches the Mobile Booking and the baggage label? All at the same time.That way thieves will not take advantage?I am 73 and in all my years of travel have never lost a bag! Until on your bus!It has cost me £150 to replace my makeup, toothbrush, medications, prescription toothpaste, costume, clothing and the rucksack.To the thief, shame on you.",13 March 2023

"Megabus Doing MegabusThe bus was on time, clean and the staff was very friendly (which I cant say for all coach serves). Internet was working and having booked extra leg room the journey was relatively comfortable. Right that's the good stuff!!Bad stuff. The website doesn't always change the date of the ticket when you book a later coach (so it now becomes early in the morning). have done this twice and both times it reverted to earlier the same day rather than the next day. Not good. What's even worse is that Megabus don't give you refunds and if you don't try and change the journey more than 214 hrs. before the coach is due to leave you will lose you money. There is no wriggle room on the 24hrs and it counts down to the minute (1 minute over and you lose out). Some would say 'well that your fault for double checking (fair enough) just giving a heads up!!",04 March 2023

Could have just sent half of the money I paid for not even using the servicesY’all re just heartless for someone moving to the uk trying adjust to the system. I booked a bus to London with my Family I mistakenly booked a return ticket for 10:30 in the morning instead of 22:30. Because u have a return policy u Made a family of 4 sleep outside of London till the next morning until we were able to raise the money and leave back to Edinburgh. Worst day of my life. I was even asking for half return of the money so we would be able to add to the cash we raised a night beforeTnx for giving us that experience.I was hoping u would even check my bookings and see I booked the tickets together to know I made a mistakeI never knew it was supposed to be 22:30 if u want to book a return ticket for the same night . That was just awful,06 March 2023

We were made to pay an extra £27 for an extra bag even though we had the same amount of bags on the trip up to Heathrow Airport with no problem or extra charge and even if this change is correct the attitude we received telling us about was not and we also witnessed to other people receiving bad attitude as well.The coach only had about 15 passengers so was nowhere near full.Also the coach was really dirty on the inside and definitely not as nice as previous one iv been on.I have used and recommended megabus quite a few times now but sadly it will be the last as the service has gone down hill !,07 March 2023

Toilet however was a disgrace and response from customer services was that toilet cleanliness is checked when bus leaves depot. They should try checking that the toilet works!!

Issues caused by subcontractorI have no issue with Megabus themselves. Unfortunately the coach I used was one they had contracted to provide the service. I was aware of this at the time of the booking.The contracted driver I had for both my journey to and from my destination a couple of days apart. He used a number of foul language derogatory terms when shouting at fellow drivers as well as when talking about them on his phone (hopefully via earpiece!). I also saw him gesticulate abusively on at least one occasion to a fellow driver.As I’ve already said it was a sub-contracted service but hardly an experience that reflects positively on either his own company or Megabus,05 March 2023

None of the Megabus personnel seemed particularly anxious or saw it as their responsibility to provide explanations or solutions.  Your tracker said bus was on time but no bus.  People were getting increasingly anxious that they would miss plane check in times etc.  Indeed one women left after getting a lift from a friend.  All in all appalling customer service and care.  We choose to come back on a flux bus which was cheaper and reliable,22 February 2023
"Bad Customer Service experienceI was made to believe by the customer care that I could get a redemption voucher/code for a booking I made which I was unable to use if I buy another ticket.

I was NOT on my phone, focused on waiting for the coach. Nothing came, only other well known companies, so after 25mins I decided to write to someone on the main chat. Apparently the bus came on time but they sent private company instead (J&B Travel) and silly me was expecting Megabus. They apologized for inconvenience and advised me to make other arrangements to get back to Leeds. No refund offered. Time and money wasted. This is some kind of joke. Had to buy another ticket for additional £26 with more trusted company. You get what you pay for I guess... Very disappointed.",06 March 2023

After he made a phone call he told us to go with him to Leeds and another bus would then take us to Middlesbrough that was due In Leeds at 6.30  This we did.  At Leeds we checked the internet.  The bus we were originally booked on was still there and being tracked but the next one wasn’t due to leave Leeds till 7.40.  Tried enquiry line, shuts 6pm.  Had no alternative but to wait till 7.40.  When this bus turned up driver told us to stand aside and he would take us if he had space.  He had and and we arrived at Middlesbrough 2 hours after the scheduled time we had booked.   Not sure what would have happened to us if he was full.  After the enquiry line shuts at 6pm there is no way to get help.  I did receive a refund for the journey but my request for assurance that in future it would be impossible to book and get tickets for journeys that don’t exist was ignored.Only use this company if you don’t mind being stranded.",18 February 2023

"Worst experience everHad to travel for an emergency trip from Birmingham to Sheffield, on 26th at 08:30pm where the bus came 2 hours and due to this I missed my connection flexibus from Sheffield to Edinburgh. Megabus driver asked me to get down at Leeds to catch Flexibus with no contact number or any relevant information. I did that in midnight so as to catch the bus to travel Edinburgh,where that bus never turned up and I ended up in Leeds station flexibus top for another hours. I tried asking help from another mega bus passed by they didn’t help me. Finally my whole night I spent on the freezing cold outside of bus station. Now I asked for my refund what they have caused me to travel to Edinburgh. Then megabus replied that they don’t refund for other bus expense.I have missed my bus from sheffield due to megabus and they are not even fair with me, not even covering the damage that they caused me. I had an interview to attend this morning in Edinburgh which was failed due to megabus. And they are not even bothered to cover my expenses that they caused me.I will never recommend my friends and family to travel in megabus as they won’t take any responsibility of their actions. I had. Whole 1:15 minutes time in between to catch bus back to Edinburgh from sheffield station. Now I lost my chance and Megabus not even bothered saying that’s not one of our buses you booked in to Edinburgh!  Now I sat at home loosing my interview opportunity, loosing my flexibus ticket around £32, then losing cancelling charges back from Edinburgh,Worst day of my life! Don’t travel with megabus they won’t take responsibility of your travel! They don’t even care. I have traveled in many coaches for so many years, never had this experience",26 February 2023

However, the staff were extremely helpful when needed for all 3 journeys and would answer any questions as best as they could. The chairs are comfortable and love that there are rubbish bags for food packaging or any type of waste. The drivers weren’t too hard or strict on passengers to do with baggage, arriving at the stand on time or bringing food from the rules onto the busses.

The only reason that I am giving 4 not 5 stars is because I paid extra both ways for pre booked seats, but never got to sit in them. And also on the way to London, we were unlucky enough to be sat by 4 rowdy youngsters who swore every other word and got louder the more beer they drank. They were asked to stop drinking by the driver but took no notice. I was glad tto get myy family off the bus.",18 February 2023

The level of attitude and rudeness of the drivers and employees is shocking!!! I’m not sure if it’s cause their fat and ugly and rethinking about how sad their life is when their working and get no sleep but for the way they look they should tone down their voice. Absolutely no manners at all so aggressive. U can literally ask one question and they will turn into a bull like chill out please work on ur service the level is respect they give their customers is shocking. Don’t even treat u like humans treat us like filthy animals. This is based off many experiences as a customer travelling with megabus but I really see a pattern. I have never been satisfied with the service the drivers or Employees give. The ones that shocked me the most was during 2 of my experiences m! one on the 10th feb Mega bus leaving to London at 11am. And 11th of November 22:30 going to London. Disappointed in this business. This business is going to go down cos everyone knows mega bus is horrible horrible. Why is ur slogan relaxing ride.

Not suitable for travelling with baby's who need nappy changes and feedsJust back from a few days in Manchester.. we travelled to and from Manchester via mega bus! I have an 8 month old baby and when booking I was never asked to bring a car seat but good job I did anyway or I wasn't getting on.. anyway the bus to Manchester was fine no real complaints other than the fact the toilet floor was absolutely swimming in urine half way through the journey but that's not the company's fault. As for the journey home the bus was delayed .. again things happen outwith the company's control and it can't be helped but because of this the driver was in an absolutely horrible mood and instantly started being cheeky to me about having my child in a car seat (which I did have anyway).. then when we did board the bus he made an announcement (clearly aimed at me) stating the child must remain in the car seat the entire time and if he was taken out I would be dropped at a bus stop or service station which ever came first .. I know there is rules but to single out someone infant of a full bus is very degrading and unprofessional. Also no food aloud on board which isnt ideal with young children on long journeys when there are no service stops.. I will not use this company again and I wish I read the reviews before booking in the first place.,15 February 2023

When we got to Glasgow we had obviously missed our 11am connection but staff at Buchanan St. Bus Station were fantastic and got us on a train instead. Having mobility issues and having to rush so far on foot to the train wiped me out for days after though so I'm not sure I would brave the journey ever again.,06 February 2023
"Delayed JourneyI would have given the service 5 stars but through no fault of their own, the bus ended up being 3 hours late. It was because the driver, who was swapping at Birmingham, was stuck in a queue on M5!  Then the driver pulled over on the hard shoulder on the M40 southbound (no idea why) on two separate occasions. I ended up getting home at an unearthly hour. Good job I had someone picking me up. Alone in Swindon, at 1am, is not something I would have relished.",06 February 2023

"Great as long as you're not in a rush!Used a few times lately to go from Birmingham to Cheltenham and back. The buses have always been clean, and you get far more leg room than you do on National Express. The drivers have been polite and helpful. The seats could do with better head support and all the seats say reserved, so it's hard to know where to sit if you didn't pay to reserve a specific seat. The toilets each time had plenty of loo roll and soap, and were clean ish - cleaner than train toilets have been on recent trips. However, the stairs down to the toilet are quite tight and steep, making it quite hard to get in and out of the toilet. Megabus don't seem as timely as National Express, so I don't think I'd use them if I was going somewhere where I couldn't afford to be late. The coach tracking is not very accurate, and I have rushed to get to the stop multiple times, with the tracker saying service on time, just to get there and wait 20 mins for the coach. The power outlets have worked each time without issue, as has the fans above the seats, making it easy to make it cooler if you wish. The temperature on the coaches has been comfortable, compared to National Express which has been freezing. I do quite like that on Megabus the loo is not on the same level as the seating, as it's a bit awkward on National Express, with a load of people sat right outside the toilet with just a 1cm thick sliding door to preserve your dignity! On Megabus, the toilet is a bit more cramped though and I'm a short bloke. Also, having the button for the water under the sink, means water drips on the floor as you have to keep using your wet hands to press the button, as the water only stays on about 5 seconds! There is also sanitiser by the doors of the coach, and I have seen drivers using the sanitiser themselves, which is good. I missed my booked coach, but the driver let me on the later service without any fuss or extra payment. Megabus could do with introducing some more flexible ticket options, so you can amend online if you need to. I gather the only ticket option is a non-refundable ticket that can't be changed. Although if all the drivers are flexible and don't make a fuss if you aren't on the journey you booked initially, then this is no big deal. Lastly, it's a bit annoying that they don't go all the way to The Town Centre in Cheltenham - instead stopping just off the M5 on the Golden Valley Roundabout. I can see why they do it, so people travelling beyond Cheltenham don't have to sit on the bus 30 mins longer for the bus to drive into the Town Centre and out again, but just keep in mind that if you are alighting at Chektenham, you'll then have to pay and get on the 94 bus to go from the Megabus Stop onto the Town Centre. That said, a single on the 94 is like £2, so still cheaper to get Megabus and pay for the bus into town, than to go with National Express and go all the way to the Town Centre. Would use Megabus again. Also wish the departures were more frequent and ideally 24/7.",12 February 2023

"Simple guide to survival when travelling on ‘Megabus’When travelling on Megabus follow these simple steps:1. Don’t bring half your worldly possessions in 12 suitcases. You’re allowed one piece of luggage and one carry on. Check the T&C’s.2. The seats aren’t a free for all. When you sit in a reserved seat that someone else has paid for, don’t look in wide eyed incredulity, pretending not to speak English when they ask you to move.3. Don’t take illicit substances prior to your journey. The people sitting around you don’t want you continuously falling on them as you seem unable to sit upright in your seat due to your drug addled stupor. Although the coach staff will ignore this by letting you on despite you looking and behaving like you ingested a gallon of methadone. Don’t  proceed to roll about the floor during the journey. It is not a good look.4. Have even a slight awareness of your fellow passengers trying to sleep by not talking in the loudest voice you can muster for hours during the journey. Same goes for playing music at a volume that would make your ears bleed. Earphones are a useful concept that should be utilised.5. Sit in your own seat. If you haven’t paid for a seat then you’re unreserved. A reserved sticker on the headrest should start ringing alarm bells with you.6. Be prepared for the coach staff to not really know their way out of London. Impromptu tours of Shepherds Bush are fun but not when you are trying to get home.7. Remember it’s Megabus. They don’t operate normal schedules. You will arrive at your destination by chance and by the will of the almighty but certainly never on time.8. Use the on board toilet at your own peril. Abandon all hope ye who dare to enter…Summary: Just take the train.",23 December 2022
"A good experience. Will travel this way again...Great, low cost way to travel to city destinations.",06 February 2023
"Constant errors, mix-ups, and non-functional featuresHad to get Megabus to take me and a friend from Edinburgh to Plymouth for a surgery. This trio became so difficult and complicated as a result. On the way there, one of our buses was delayed by half an hour which meant we missed our next bus change (which we’d reserved seats on). The people at the station arranged for another Megabus vehicle to take us. They had us and three other people who missed the bus due to the delay stand outside and told us they’d let us on in two minutes. They had seats visibly available from outside. They then pulled away and left while we were standing right there, and when we asked for help the station staff contacted the driver who told them he thought we’d gotten on the bus already (???).On the way back, our bus broke down and we were left in the road for two hours. Every bus we could have taken was leaving in the meantime - eventually the last bus home was rapidly coming up and we were repeatedly ignored when we asked to be allowed to leave the bus so we could run and get an Uber to take us to the station instead. In the end, we ended up completely missing the last bus, and had to beg until they got them to turn around and take us.On every single Megabus during this trip (5 in all), the USB charging ports never worked, not once. Five different buses with zero ability to charge phone, headphones, etc. They also had no wifi despite advertising that they did.We’ll definitely be requesting a partial refund at the very least - missing multiple buses because of their own errors on multiple days to the point we were almost stranded in another country, and to on top of that not even have working charging ports to have our phones working, is ridiculous.",09 February 2023

At one point he told me I had to get off his bus and I wasn’t able to travel on the service I paid for. Megabus has a gap at the front of the bus at the dashboard where things accidentally fall down. There’s a sign but there’s still a gap where items can fall. I was left stranded in Birmingham at 4am with no way of making it to where I was going. After speaking to multiple sources from mega bus I was told this is a frequent occurrence. If this happens so much why is there still a gap where people’s valuables can still be lost.",01 February 2023

There was enough time to let them get in, but the harsh behaviour of the driver was our first experience in this country. They won't refund  (understandable), and they won't even suggest booking for the next bus—insulting behaviour.

Laughable. I was there. No bus showed up.I've exchanged several emails with them now but they still insist the bus was there, so no refund is due.I'm not using Megabus ever again.

"No information on late running whatsoeverFirst time on a coach (because of rail strike) - the journey from Nottingham to London was very good (on time, friendly driver, clean bus) - but the return journey was awful insofar it was announced to running late (in the end it was one and a half hour). What was the annoying and unacceptable part that no information how long the delay could be (not interested why it was delayed). If we would have known the approximate delay, we could have gone for something to eat and drink, but not knowing an approx. delay it was not possible to do so. Was it the first and last time on a coach?",01 February 2023

"Shocking bus serviceThis is a terrible bus service and shocking seat issues. Customers believe they are entitled to seats when they are not pre-booked. Bus was late and then we had an unscheduled stop on the way for no apparent reason. I will never use this service again due to the lack of professionalism and absolute tardiness of the service. Customer service number is an utter joke of an issue too not knowing why there are unscheduled stops and myself needing to investigate the matter with the bus driver. As a first time customer of this service this will be my last time i will use this service and will strongly recommend to others what a joke and shocking lack of communication is carried out by the company. Seats should be allocated additionally.  My partner and I had to sit separately as a family of 4 chose to sit on their own and have two seats each rather than sitting together as a unit. Absolutely a joke. Additionally no fresh air in the bus which stunk of bad body odour and cigarettes throughout the journey, was a nauseating experience throughout.",06 February 2023

"Horrible customer serviceBus was meant to arrive Middlesbrough by 13:50 on the 2nd of February, 2013 but didn’t show up till almost 1 hour later and the worst looking bus appeared. This bus crawled and eventually made a swap where all passengers were trans loaded into another bus because that bus couldn’t even get to leeds. We arrived leeds late of course and missed the transit bus and was made to wait forever for a different bus that showed up eventually after a very tiring wait and said he couldn’t carry me because my luggage is passed 20kg.  He said I can’t get on the bus.  I tried to explain that I don’t live in leeds and was brought all the way from Middlesbrough and this would be the 3rd bus on the same journey but driver and conductor insisted that I must get off the bus and they won’t take me. Initially they said I must leave my luggage behind in leeds was the only condition to take me then when I finally accept ed they said they won’t even take me as it’s their right to refuse me a ride. I was angry and then I called the customer service representative who was so dismissive and nonchalantly advised me to find my way to London. No refund , compensation or apology was issued. The bus that left me had space for luggage’s and extra seats available.  One of my co passengers was even travelling without a luggage at all. I asked to pay for the extra luggage (which is just one suitcase by the way) and they just won’t let me ride on the bus.",02 February 2023

My coach arrived 3 hours later to LeedsMy coach to Leeds from Birmingham arrived an hour late. I was told I would get to Leeds at 7:10.

Also If I had known I'd be on the couch 2 hours longer than scheduled I could have got enough water and something to eat for the journey. When I asked the driver what time we would arrive at Leeds he replied 'No idea mate'Overall it was not a pleasant experience and some transparency about arrival times would have made things more manageable and I would have been able to better plan my arrival at Leeds and not nearly end up with nowhere to say for the evening,03 February 2023

Shocking Edinburgh bus staff bus bullying behaviour by Bus Station supervisorShocking Edinburgh bus staff member.Bullied humiliated forced to apologise when I threaten to report him for his behaviour when we were herded off what should have been a delightful simple direct journey Glasgow - Newcastle but instead turned into total chaos in Edinburgh.I won’t explain the total lack of care or customer service that ensued but as someone who travels a lot it was shocking. I’m now taking up the entire shocking experience with mega bus.Can I also point out I didn’t pay nothing to get on this bus. It was the same price as my single train fare would have been but I made an informed choice to pay the fare because it was direct and seemed a better option not because it was the cheaper option this time. I’ve also used mega bus a hundred times Glasgow - Edinburgh and loved the service. Never any issues - always have Wi-Fi and fantastic friendly professional drivers.The issue here was an Edinburgh bus station supervisor and a total lack of customer support from Megabus in looking after passengers when they suddenly told everyone on the coach going to Newcastle to get off the bus .. collect their luggage chaotically and then hang around waiting to get on another single deck bus that clearly didn’t have enough seats to take new passengers and the passengers from the bus I was leaving.The entire experience was horrendous.,03 February 2023

I was nervous the first couple of weeks due to it being out of my comfort zone  but I didn't let that stop me. I have recommended Mega bus to friends and family as i feel its a lot more sustainable and cheaper than other modes of transport. The drivers make my journey welcoming, even at the earliest hours in the morning when I'm  to tired to say anything. Puts a smile on my face to be greeted first thing in the morning.It's 1 hour and 20 mins on the coach to get to where i need to be, very great-full as I'm able to get to places on schedule !I recommend Mega bus to those who are finding it difficult to pay for a train ticket or any other sort of transport. Prices do vary depending on time of day or how close you buy the ticket.I have met a few different characters on the coach the  past 7 months while travelling, though I like keeping to myself, My comfort zone does not feel threatened and have always felt comfortable sitting with those around me .

"Fantasic ladies at stznsted xxAfter flight delays, i ended up at stansted n needed to get to mcr airport.easy to book online n reserve my seat, very esdy even for a tekkie no hoper like me xx easy to find thd machine at stansted n print my ticket from their machine. There were 2 ladies helping the passengers find the right bus. It was freezing cold, 1 am but these lasses were just so lovely, warm n helpful i could have cried. Last gime i did a nightbus was some 40 yrs ago n it was scary, drunks n hassle all the way but i had to get home so tho my bus stopped at mcr airport its final destination was glasgow so i braced myself for drunken see you jimmy types. We set off n the driver kindly adised that any unacceptable behaviour would mean being put off the bus pronto . I snoozed a bit, looked out thde window a bit n the 4 hr journey passed in comfirt n a feeling of safety. Incredible cheap price too, from £11. I wd not hesitate to recommend this service and will always remember the 2 lovely ladies at stansted xxx it was sat nite/sunday mirning of 21st january.

"DangerousAlways over 2 hours late. No matter the day or service number. Wrong and Inaccurate information. Just look on their Twitter every bus, every route breaking down every single day. No compensation just snarky responses. If the coaches are in this much of a sorry state they're clearly not road worthy. Don't risk it and save yourself a three hour wait in the cold. Loads of fees, actually an expensive way to travel comparatively. Have used for 2 years and the service has only gotten worse and worse and upped in price. Will never use again and recommend people stay well clear.Last straw they left my father in the freezing cold for nearly 3 hours with no updates nor even so much as a sorry. Will be taking further action.",05 February 2023

"Racistism and grab money without any faultToday my husband and brother going birmingham to Heathrow airpirt. They are 2 passengers and 2 luggage with them. My brother wore turban on his head. The guy was racist.  He did not allow to travel that bus. According to terms and conditions one passenger can ride with one luggage and they were two passenger and 2 luggage.  They also wrote on their website if any extra luggage need to pay £10 extra. We ready to pay £50 as well. We also show 1 passenger return ticket as well. But the driver don't know how to speake with passengers. So I hire taxi £160 . I make an complaint but the guy on phone told its non refund ticket. I almost lost more than £80 on 3 tickets, £13:50 for car parking in Birmingham and £160 to hire taxi because we can't miss flight its cost me more. Because of their driver fault I pay too much and now without our fault they grab us money. So I will not recommend to anybody. The staff over the phone and drivers are non experience. If passengers have fault that fine they can charge but now they have fault. My husband told ro driver he will not go but please allow my brother because he have flight and with 2 tickets 1 passenger can go with 2 luggage and for return ticket we will not get any refund but please allow. They did not allow us but he allow one drunk person who lost his mind in bus.",04 February 2023

"HelloHello,We have traveled from London to Leeds .Talking about the journey experience we got both, good as well as bad experience. As we have booked front seat of upper deck to capture the landscape and enjoy the scenery . Unfortunately they came with single deck coach .There was a change of driver and couch both in Sheffield but after 3:30 hour journey passed. There was only one hour left to reach the destination in which we cannot capture any proper view because it was foggy atmosphere there and this again messed up the journey.On other hand ,Coach was very clean and tidy . Seats were comfortable. We reached Leeds safely in that harsh weather and as per the time schedule also.Overall, we just request mega bus management to give full information before boarding on couch to there customers so that we do not get any sock seeing different coaches for our service.RegardsNirav mehta",21 January 2023

We had to wait in a veranda. We were planning to at any nearest coffee shop. Meanwhile when I went out to find any coffee shop, one driver just asked me if I was looking for the bus for London? and told me that bus is at the stand and, is about to leave for London. We got it at the last moment.It was managed so poor that if we would have gone for coffee, keeping in mind 45 minutes the gap as we were told from information window, we would have missed our journey.

After about an hour and half or more, a group of engineers finally arrived to bus to get the door fixed. Unfortunately, it seemed the door was heavily damaged so it couldn’t be fixed. The only thing good out of the situation which I’m grateful for, is that taxis were ordered for passengers.",05 January 2023

"Bus from Sunderland was 50 minutes…Bus from Sunderland was 50 minutes late, then on our journey the bus stopped and we were told to get onto another bus ,so we had to gather our belongings and our suitcases and get onto another bus. Arrival was supposed to be around 1800hrs, it was actually around 19.20hrs.I walked round to Victoria train station to find it was closed,walked back to Victoria coach station, by which time it was 19.40. I stood in a queue to buy a ticket to brighton ,whilst in the queue I was told the kiosk would be closing shortly,luckily I got to the front only to be told there weren't any buses left that could take me to my final destination! I really do hope you can imagine how I was feeling by then, all alone, stuck in London!! I was very emotional when I had to tell my brother who was expecting me. The Only solution was for my sister in law to drive from Brighton and come get me. It was nearly midnight when I finally got  to Brighton.  This is not the first time that traveling with megabus has been disappointing , I use this way of transport quite often to visit my brother and work.I'm really reluctant to use it again",05 January 2023

"I travelled with MEGABUS on the 5th Jan…I travelled with MEGABUS on the 5th Jan 23, from Preston to Glasgow. In anticipation of high demand & delays, I've booked a prime seat #68 at additional cost to normal reservation fee, some 9 days in advance. My reservation was on lower forward deck, a window facing forward seat with a central table, dedicated for the cluster of 2 x 2 seats facing each other. The MEGABUS arrived in Preston almost 3 hours late, however since I expected delays, this was not the main reason for my dissatisfaction, but what followed was totally unacceptable. I boarded the bus to find my reserved seat was taken up by another passenger, I pointed this out to one of the 2 MEGABUS drivers, who failed to take any action & advised me to find a seat on upper deck, since I had a reservation I declined & politely pointed out to person in my reserved seat of his mistake, he advised me that he also had a reservation & was in the correct seat. At this point I requested the proof of his reservation, he obliged in calm manner but it turned out his reservation was for a seat #6 which was on buses upper deck! I politely asked him to vacate my reserved seat & requested the co-drivers assistance. Once again, the driver appeared reluctant  to get involved, blamed the delays & asked me to temporarily take up a seat on upper deck until the bus arrived in Lancaster, where a lot of the passengers were disembarking  In order to minimise further delays, I agreed. Upon arrival to Lancaster, once again, I pointed out the reservation error to one of the drivers, who once again did NOT make any attempts to ensure I was allocated my reserved seat, instead he offered me an alternative seat on the lower deck. In order to calm things down, also to de-escalate this very unsatisfactory situation & standards, I reluctantly accepted, the MEGABUS arrived in Glasgow at 21:05, exactly3 hours late. This was never a case of ""double booking"" I had the correct reservation, where as the other passenger did  not & it was entirely the duty & responsibility of the MEGABUS Crew to ensure this procedure was applied! .... I intend to submit a full & more detailed complaint to MEGABUS ... In future, its FLEXIBUS for me!",05 January 2023
"Driver shortage Newcastle to London coachI have been getting the megabus from London to Newcastle,  and Newcastle to London for a fair few years now and the last two time on my return journey Newcastle to London we the passengers have been told we have to change coach half way back due to lack of drivers, and our driver having done his full 4 hrs. So we were two time now changed to a diff coach,  with still 3 hrs of our journey left to London, to a smaller coach where the gaps between each seat is so cramped, the person in front is literally in your lap. Hardly any leg space. I found both time I could not wait to get off this second coach the journey was not good at all. This is why I changed and now use National express coaches. I did complain to megabus but they are not interested at all. They said we can't help having coach breakdown issues, well it wasn't a broken down cosch it was a lack of coach drivers! Our driver told us this both times. I was so stressed on the second coach . This never used to happen but seems now a regular issue with megabus they need more drivers!! Also I'd paid for extra leg room seats, and on second coach I never had this, because as I say coach was smaller leg room was cramped. I'd not recommend this journey with megabus.",18 October 2022
"Overlong journey from Glasgow to Inverness.The journey from Glasgow to Inverness was fine until the Megabus stopped in a layby for no apparent reason for 5 minutes, started up and continued for a while and stopped again. Started moving again then a few miles before Aviemore stopped in a layby. After at least 5 minutes a few people got off. I got off, and asked the driver what was happening. He answered me quite dismissively, as if I didn't need to know. The suspension was broken apparently.My complaint is this: The driver has an intercom. He could easily, without much effort, have used it to let everyone on board know what the reason was for the latest stoppage. Instead, we were left in the dark. Most of us would have had people waiting at the destination to pick us up. All we could do was tell them the bus was delayed, with no information about why or for how long. The driver needs to bear in mind that he is providing a service, not just earning a paypacket. There was no disgruntlement once people knew what was happening. But plenty from the people in the bus that picked us up!!! They weren't happy at all with a big influx of passengers ruining the cosy vibe!!",13 January 2023

Lack of refund option.Booked in case needed as train strike timetable not announced until a few days before by then any coach tickets may have gone.

Then the bus got stuck in traffic on the A34 but this is just a hazard of travelling by road. My return journey from Southampton to Coventry was seamless however.  Overall I would say the Megabus offers great value for money.  If I could offer one wish for Megabus it would be for there to be some form of real time information update so that people waiting at the bus station can know if the bus is running late, and what time it is expected.  You probably have this on your app to be fair, which I will download for future trips.",29 December 2022

"Appalling serviceI booked the 04.10 service from Sheffield Meadowhall on Thursday 29th December to take my son to see a show and enjoy a full day in London as a pre-exam treat. My husband was also with us. We arrived at the interchange at 03:45 and waited for the bus. Several other passengers were arriving for the same journey. When the bus hadn’t arrived by 04:15, we tried to check its whereabouts on the ‘live’ app. All we could see was that it had left Glasgow on time the previous evening and was making its way south. The last update was added at Newcastle Upon Tyne several hours earlier.We waited and waited, trying to get updates from various sources. By 6am we were feeling quite annoyed at the lack of customer service and had started looking at rail tickets and were willing, at this point, to spend in excess of £200 for train tickets, despite already having paid almost £80 for our return bus journey.  I had been keen to avoid travelling by train because of all the recent strikes and didn’t want to end up disappointed. At around 06:15 a Megabus pulled into the interchange. I went to speak to the driver and was informed that our bus had broken down near Newcastle, but he had seen it pull into Leeds around 45 minutes ago. He assured me that it would be arriving in a short while as there weren’t many passengers waiting to board. We decided not to go and get the train, but to wait for the Megabus. This arrived almost an hour later and we eventually set off at 07:14, which was just over 3 hours later than planned. There was no apology from the driver or his companion and no explanation of what had happened.We spent the day in London and were then booked on a return Megabus at 22:00 from Victoria coach station.We arrived at 21:15 and it was utter chaos. Various coaches were coming in and leaving full of passengers. Each Megabus that was scheduled was late. Passengers travelling to Glasgow and Edinburgh didn’t seem to have a clue what they were doing and various staff were just getting them on buses so as to get them out of the bus station and on their way to their destinations.We kept hearing announcements over the tannoy and a very stressed staff member kept telling us our bus was nearby, but it had stopped for fuel and a toilet break for the driver! Interestingly, another passenger told me that when he’d been travelling down the week before Christmas, the bus had been delayed for 3 hours because it had broken down near Newcastle. I immediately assumed that this is a standard line that is fed to customers in order to try and justify lateness. Our bus eventually left Victoria at 23:20, meaning that in total, we had spent 4.5 hours in one day waiting around for Megabuses. It’s the first time we’ve used the service for several years. Sadly, I was very, very disappointed. We travel to London fairly often, but this really has made me feel like I would not use Megabus again, or recommend it to anyone.I wasn’t going to bother sending a review as I’m not confident it will even be read, let alone dealt with. It’s worrying when there are vulnerable people travelling alone at night, just left at pick up points without live updates.",29 December 2022

The bus was late arriving because another Megabus was still in Stand1 and was preventing the London bus from docking. Stand 2 was empty and surely could have been used. I watched the London Bus do at least 4 circuits of the bus station before being able to come into place. On the way, I learned that we would have to change buses at Tibshelf! There had been no prior notification of that. I had paid to reserve a seat, but then found that was only valid to Tibshelf.

"Terrible cancellation policy!I booked an advance round-trip ticket from Bournemouth - London Victoria  for 3rd January, returning London - Bournemouth., Friday 6th Jan. This was an alternative route to my regular commute on Southwest trains, due to rail strike.Due to encountering  bachache 2 days prior to trip, I had to cancel, due to illness. . Seeking a refund I found the only way this could be done, was via email to Megabus, as there was no telephone numbers shown on website. In general I simply required reimbursement or at least the chance to change to an alternative date. Besides the cancellation issue. I have found Megabus operate a great budget transport alternative to Southwest Trains and National Express Coaches.",02 January 2023

"I didn't realize an app for tracking… (Update)I didn't realize an app for tracking the bus was available. At the bus stop I knew the bus was going to be late because another passenger had the app & was informing passengers. To be fair lateness was because of the rail strike & heavy passenger numbers. Had I known about the bus I would have arrived at a different time & to be fair, the bus turned up at the time the app said it would but the only problem was the app wasn't updated for a whole hour before the new arrival time so everyone was in the dark about the progress of the buses journey. Apart from that which is minor & my fault for not knowing about the bus tracker the service was really good.UpdateRebooked with Megabus for travel on the 24th Feb.As I now knew about the link on their website I was closely following the bus from the start of its journey. The bus, which was the same service I caught the last time [M36] left a bit late, However there were several incidents that were totally out of Megabus's control, there were animals on the M6 & once it got through that there was a vehicle fire on the M5. Which caused the bus to be over 2hrs late. Luckily I had the information via their website & it was being updated in real time. I was able to make alternative travel arrangements to my destination.  I was there just as the bus was leaving Cheltenham.",06 January 2023

Reserved and paid for a particular seat…Reserved and paid for a particular seat and a replacement coach was sent for the journey (not a Megabus coach). The seat layout on this replacement coach was different to the Megabus seat layout. The driver instructed me and other customers with reserved seats to sit elsewhere as customers were already sat on the reserved numbered seat and to contact Megabus in regards to a refund. So when I contacted Megabus they told me that as I was able to travel on my journey they were unable to issue me a refund for the seat reservation cost which was an extra charge on top of the ticket price. Very poor service from Megabus. Will stick to National Express from now on.,03 January 2023

"DISGUSTING EXPERIENCEI arrived to the uk with 3 kids. (5, 8 and 16) with luggages on the 24th Dec 2022, we were about to take the megabus coach which my Aunty had booked for us, i think it was 13:30 i think. The driver (I couldn't take his name) refused point blank to carry us saying that i had too many luggages, not considering the kids that had been in the cold for so long and as a result caught cold in the process.I took megabus again days later hoping for you guys to send me a survey so that i can tell you my experience,  since it was not me that booked the first one i used, as such, survey got sent to my Aunty.In all honesty, it will be great if someone responds to my feedback but i wont hold my breath to be honest but now that i have expressed my view and someone seen it, i am now satisfied but one thing for sure, never again will i take megabus in the UK because my first experience was nothing to sing praises about.",24 December 2022

It wasn't a problem for me as I ended up moving to the seat behind the driver and was on my own. I think where the problem arose was that on the Megabus website it showed an old seating map and the bus which was used had a different seating plan.On the plus side the ride was very smooth, the driver was very careful and marvellous going through the traffic in London.

TerribleThe bus was over full. People were arguing. Driver was swearing at the other cars loudly and deliberately driving dangerously. Toilet was overflowing and stank. An hour later to depart,04 January 2023
"Megabus bagpolice beware!Traveling home for Xmas from Italy, trains were on strike, so tried megabus as recommended.Bus was over 1 hour late, I hopped of for a quick smoke at Leeds or York and the driver came rushing at me saying I couldn’t get back on the bus because ‘d been drinking whiskey. I begged him to allow me to stay on, he literally searched the back pack of the girl that was sitting next to me, backpack, throwing everything out on the floor outside on the floor, when he didn’t find whiskey in her bag, he leapt onto the bus, grabbing my back and confiscated my duty frees, which I littereally only opened at Manchester to give a fellow traveler a nip, and taste.  The bottle was full.  I was stone cold sober, but any merriment I had traveling home soon faded. The girl on the bus was a stranger. We were both outraged by his actions and felt extremely threatened by his hostility and anger, I believed he would have been happy to leave me there, destitute, my suitcase on the bus, no other way of making it home in the freezing cold.He was screaming and yelling like a lunatic!Even if the bottle hadn’t have been full, his approach was in called for, a simple warning would have been sufficient, we were crossing no borders, he had absolutely no right or authority what so ever to rake through our personal belongings, nor steal them I done nothing illegal and yet felt like a criminal when in fact it was he who without warrant or warning became intimidating and unlawfully searched and took my possessions.I did not press charges, though I should have had I had time, but was only home to take care of my terminally ill mother which totally overshadowed the bus experienceI do believe that he broke the law, though I couldn’t find it any where, and was certainly not aware, as many others aren’t who I’ve spoken to since, that he claims it’s against bus policy?A policy is not a law, and he is not above the law to treat a vulnerable female traveling alone in such a manner.I would like compensated but don’t expect it from this company",16 December 2022
Unacceptable and awfulIt was unacceptable event that the driver left us because he said that our luggages will not fit in the bus anymore eventhough we have reserved seats. Good thing megabus sent taxis to bring us to London but we’ve waited more than an hour in a rainy early hours of the morning.,04 January 2023
"Late and bad organisationThere were 2 coaches for this journey, and even though the number of people travelling was known beforehand, loading of the second coach did not start until after the scheduled departure time. I was then late for my destination. I had paid for and reserved a seat but it was taken. So I had to sit elsewhere on the coach.On the way back, I had my reserved seat but the power socket did not work. So I couldn't charge my phone for the 5 hour journey back to London.",07 January 2023

"Waiting in the darkImagine, if you will, two weary travellers complete with heavy suitcases condemned to suffer the chilly and rackety hell of Leeds City Bus Station awaiting the arrival of Megabus from Leeds to Hull at 2000. After a Greggs bake and coffee and a visit to the loo we made our way to Stand 1, which is the little spot slightly modified to resemble a minimal departure ""lounge"" at the required 15 minutes prior to departure. At least, we comforted ourselves, we had paid on top of the exorbitant and rail-strike induced ticket price to bag two front seats (extra £6).We waited and waited. A late running Middlesbrough bus pulled in, eliciting much anticipation and excitement from those who could not determine whether it went via Goole. There was no indication of what had happenened to our bus and as the minutes passed by, into 15 and 30 we began to panic. The board at the end of the stand invited me to press a button for ""information"". Button duly pressed and it told me, in reassuring tones, that this was Stand 1 for all Megabus services. Thanks for that. Not having a smartphone, I couldn't ""track"" our bus - and a young man in the queue had little luck with his device which failed to provide any information.50 minutes late a ""Snowdon's"" coach (Van Hool/Volvo) wheezed in and we boarded. No reserved seats, no explanation of the nearly an hour's delay, no apology. Nothing. I ventured a crack about getting our reserved seat money back. This was not received well, the intimation being that we were lucky to get a bus at all.Having said that, the driver made very good progress back to Hull, cutting a good 20 minutes off the usual time.It was just a crying shame that there was no information whatsoever regarding this service's delay and no attempt to even justify its late arrival.Black Mark Megabus. Nat Ex for me next, I think...",05 January 2023

"We booked seats round a tableWe booked seats round a table, they seats were numbered however one of the drivers told us they were numbered wrong so we had to move all our stuff, then the other driver told us to move we were in wrong seats so had to move everything again, journey was really uncomfortable as there was not enough leg room for four people at a table seat for that length of journey, the heaters were on made us too hot, there was no break to stretch legs or get a hot drink, the toilet had no toilet paper, no soap and no hand towels from the start of the journey, I went twice and they were not there at beginning or end of journey, we were doing the trip to London from Glasgow and return for my 60th birthday surprise from my two daughters to visit my son and family and it was too long without a break, too hot and uncomfortable and toilet unprepared for travellers, also the same as the arrival journey the return was 35 mins early so could have allowed a stop",08 January 2023
"The bus arrived pretty much on time and…The bus arrived pretty much on time and was only 10-15 minutes delayed on arrival at the end destination. However, during the journey, the top deck was like an oven and despite instructions to the driver to turn down the heating, not much improved. I decided to move to the lower deck where there was a spare seat free. Unfortunately, I had to pinch my nose/grit my teeth to tolerate the stink coming from the toilet behind me. The door wouldn't shut properly and the door was insufficiently sealed to prevent smells escaping. All in all, Megabus got me there pretty much on time, but the interior user experience really destroyed the overall impression. Much room for improvement.",04 January 2023
Inconsiderate terms of serviceYour terms of services are not considerate & largely imposing. It’s always regrettable having a change in circumstances less than 24hrs to booked travel time. You are not sympathetic to the financial challenges majority of your customer base are facing by forcing them to forfeit their money because they can’t change their tickets.,24 December 2022

"Don't bother and take the train, national express or driveBooked weeks ago a trip to London from Leeds day return due to train strikes. Never heard of megabus but thought I'd give it a whirl.Early start, bus on time. Travelled to meadowhall where told to get off as the coach in front will be quicker as it's direct. The one we was on was only stopping off at Leicester so it felt an awful lot of faff of taking luggage off to save essentially 5 minutes despite it taking 10 to offload and reload luggage. Go fathom.Despite this outgoing journey was quick, on time and in London by 10.30.Unfortunately return journey-horrendous experience. Waited at finchley road. Bus late by over 80 minutes. It was the last bus of the day, freezing cold, no updates, app not working. Said bus was running to time. As a mother with children I didn't have a clue what to do. Keep waiting in freezing cold weather around drunk people trying to set the local subway on fire (fantastic!) or give up and book somewhere.When it turned up the driver's mate was rude, abnoxious, attitude. No explanation given at all. We found out by other people that it was delayed to fill and clean the bus. It turned up on time at Victoria but was sat for ages with no one doing anything.We were the lucky ones and actually got on. Two people wasn't allowed to get on because they should have got on at Victoria. They had clearly paid for their seats so should be available. Bus wasn't full with spare seats so just what was the problemAnother couple didn't get on either. They had over done the luggage. Hadn't read the small print it would seem. Could argue it was their fault however it got heated and unprofessional on both sides. More to the point we were a party of 4 with NO luggage. So there would have been plenty of space in the hold. They just didn't care or try.Unbelievable.Glad to get home over 90 minutes after we should have but at least we did.I feel sorry for the other 2 couples. Wont be using again. Unprofessional, unhelpful, no reply to emails several days on. Just smacks really that they don't care.Not willing to take the risk of being potentially stranded.Never again",07 January 2023

"Waiting for a busThere was a bit of confusion before bus/coach came as a mega bus was already in waiting then a Turners coach turnt up. And the lady driver, who changed shift. Told us that could be our bus/coach, bit of shoving and pushing went on. I didn't particularly appreciate this as I'd been stood waiting for 20mins now I'm at the back of the queue. Plus slightly disabled ( but not wavkng thst flag.) Driver turns out to be very efficient and we made good time. Would use again.",05 January 2023
Good driving.Good driving.The seats were almost comfortable. They were too small for many of the younger people on the trip.The toilet was a centre for injury in trying to descend during a journey involving sudden stops and winding trafficways. I injured my head,08 January 2023
FRAUDULENTWe booked a ride on spot to catch a bus scheduled to leave that minute. Payment went through and we waved the driver just as he was trying to leave the park but he just didn’t stop and drove out of the park. Why would you take payment for a trip you can’t commit to.

"Irratic bus driverI didnt mind that the bus was an hour late but.... when we got on the ""megabus"" that wasnt actually a mega bus, or a national express coach, other people were turned away because there was no more luggage space, luckily we didnt have any luggage so were able to travel. When we finally got started on our journey when we were on the motorway our driver decided to cause road rage with a bus full of people with a truck driver in the outside lane! He was driving and swerving at speed and honking his horn at the driver! We did not feel safe and thought at one point we actually might crash! It was unbelievable actually",05 January 2023

"Hello,Hello,I hand an extra hand luggage ( the one that is used on the planes) and the driver insisted that I buy an extra ticket for that hand luggage 42 £ extra is a bit high. While I understand it is of your terms and conditions; normal course of action is paying a fine for the extra luggage not a whole  ticket. When I discussed that with the driver he said that it is a decision of the admin staff at Victor station and they were not there at 11 30 pm so I had to buy the extra ticked. It is disappointing because I booked the ticket last minute after missing a bus with another company Flex because of delay at the airport so the journey’s cost was over 116£, thanks",08 January 2023

I paid and I boarded with my family because we were afraid of missing our flight! Arriving at the airport and after we asked the driver why our tickets are so expensive (normally they are around 17 pounds), he sent us to find someone at the main station of the airport but to our surprise there was NO employee and everything was closed!! At Victoria station the employee had issued us a ticket for the final destination (journey 3 ½ hours) while I repeatedly told him that we were going to the Heathrow airport (journey 40 minutes)!!!!!",05 January 2023

"When boarding its a free for all to get…When boarding its a free for all to get a seat this creates an issue for passengers that have reserved seats which in turn causes problems for the bus staff and results in buses leaving late.Reserved seats were not marked as reserved therefore passengers travelling just took any seat. Furthermore, the seating plan on the bus did not match the seating plan on the website as the bus has a completely different layout hence with some of the reserved paying travellers their seat number did not exist.What can be done to avoid these difficult situations is to ensure the seating plan for the relevant buses are correct for passengers when booking and reserving online, secondly reserved seating passengers board first on the bus which will leave the vacant seats for the remaining travellers which will help your company employees from these unnecessary and sometimes volatile situations.",28 December 2022

Very bad experienceVery bad experience. We have booked and reserved our ticket before one month of our journey. Still we dont get seat and standing for 5 hours of journey.

"Bus reached 3hrs late to the…Bus reached 3hrs late to the destination, it was tooooooo cold inside the bus, warmers didn’t work…. From Manchester to Weston Super Mare",02 January 2023
"Pretty stressful first experienceMy first experience of catching the 9.30 from Victoria to Leeds was joining a very long queue at gate 16. The electronic board indicated it was the right queue and then without warning it changed to the next bus due, to Bristol, once 9.30 had passed...which of courses causes stress for many customers. A number of customers went to the Megabus stand to check the situation after 9.30 but there was a delay there. When the server came out of the office to check what was happening, he could see we were agitated, but not rude. He then started shouting at me /us. The departure gate was then opened after the scheduled departure and people somehow had to work out what was going on as the queue was serving two destinations, and there was no clear announcement. This bus left at 10am but arrived on time. There was no clues about whether WiFi actually existed on this unbranded Megabus nor how we would access it. Nothing obvious came up on our phones. My phone couldn't be charged by the supply points so ran out during the journey meaning I had to use a much better charging point provided on the street, outside Leeds coach station, in the rain...but at least I could then find my hotel. So generally a disorganised, stressful first experience of using Megabus with many if the advertised facilities not working, including the live bus tracker too(?!)",03 January 2023
What's the point of booking seatsMy seat was taken when I got on and I said to the lady that she was sitting in my seat but she just smiled I'm not one to complain but what's the point of booking seats I have vertigo and sitting at the side of stairs was not a good experience for me,31 December 2022
"Terrible. Will avoid at all costsThe heating was on full blast with no air con or fresh air for almost 5 hours.  We were told it was broken. People had their phones or tablets on watching films and there was not any announcement as on other coach companies to use headphones for the comfort of other passengers. The rack where u keep hand luggage broke. The driver wasn't very professional in my opinion and some passengers missed their stop because no one announced it. Others almost got off thinking they had made their destination so there was utter confusion. 😳 people had to just throw their own cases under the coach. I used national express going to my break and this was done for you in a more organised fashion.When trying to get the coach from London Victoria the offices were closed, despite saying they should be open and there were no staff around to help. When they finally did arrive he was talking on his phone ignoring passengers. It was very disorganised and staff were unprofessional.On a plus the driver allowed us to get off at the next stop which was more convenient for us.",29 December 2022

Staff were rude and nastyStaff were rude and nasty. When we stopped at the service station I was unaware that we wouldn’t be getting off as I’d never ridden a megabus before so when I went downstairs and asked the member of staff if we were getting off they first ignored me and looked at each other like I was crazy so I joked “I just wanted something to eat” and a guy with glasses said to me “ well you should have brought something shouldn’t ya” which was some some reason the most hilarious thing him and his dusty bus cronies had ever heard and they all laughed loudly at me as I walked back up the stairs. Really nasty and unreasonable response from them when I was asking a genuine question. This was the Glasgow to Lancaster 11am service on Boxing Day. The staff members were all vile and found my confusion at a coach stopping at a service station might mean we got off for a few minutes to be the funniest thing they’d ever heard apparently.

This then impacted upon our plans in London, meaning we could not find alternative travel in the time we needed to arrive. Not only had we lost a lot of money on our mega bus tickets, but also the money we had spent on engagements once we arrived in London.There were no updates on the tracking app and no communication from anyone regarding the disruption to the service.I then sent an email complaining and in response to this, only received the outbound journey refund. I was then told that mega bus were unable to refund me the inbound journey as that ran as planned. However, we did not travel the inbound journey as we couldn’t even make it to London in the first place! I was then told I could have vouchers to cover the inbound journey, however my faith in the company actually providing the service that I would wish to receive is low.I am very, very disappointment and would not recommend this service to anybody!It is even more shocking that when you read all the reviews, most of which echo mine, that mega bus aren’t doing more to improve their service and most importantly support their customers!",29 December 2022

My son was waiting for an hour at the Sheffield stop without any information about the bus delay. I only found out more by going on Twitter and seeing another customer asking about the journey. Just some notification about what was happening would have been good. I spent over 10 minutes on my Spanish phone waiting for someone to answer. No one did. Lack of communication seems to be the problem!!! No one at the stop knew what was going on,03 January 2023

Told minimum of 2 hour wait.Hoping for more transparency, I called customer service who were NO Help. Terrible and uncaring.That lady working the phoneline has no business working as a customer support agent. Felt like my fellow travellers and I were on our own.Engineer arrived just shy of 2:30 in the morning. I pointed out that another bus was due to arrive shortly, headed to Newcastle. Why weren't the driver or the customer support agent the ones to come up with this solution????If I hasn't looked at Google Maps and seen that another bus was due, how long would we have waited???Our original estimated time of arrival was 1am on Dec 30th. We arrived at past 3am. An older lady was greatly alarmed and anxious as she had a taxi service waiting for her, and she had to keep begging the taxi service agent to please have a taxi wait for her.What most displeases me about the whole experience was the ineptitude, the neglectful and uncaring attitude from the customer support agent.

I didn’t expect that megabus would act irresponsible on New Year’s Day.We came to know that there was 2 buses (M10) scheduled on the same time to Bristol. the intermediate stops were different for these buses.Only one bus showed up.Driver mixed passengers from both buses and put in to one bus until that bus full. And then they asked us to wait telling that they will find the solution soon.but they didn’t. After waiting for more than 3 hours for the bus on the same gate, security guard came and told us to move to the 7 am bus gate stand where we can catch the next bus.Because of this, I had to cancel and rebook my further journeys from Bristol.

She explained that this was her food for the journey and he again refused her the bag on the bus and she was made to put in with the suitcases. This meant my 16 yr old daughter was left with no food or drink the entire journey which is not acceptable. My daughter was also left feeling very anxious and distressed. The bus was not full. My daughter traveled the journey with empty seats next to her so there was no excuse for her not to be allowed this bag of food on the bus with herWe SSE a family use mega bus a lot and have done for many years and this is the first time this has happened but as my daughter was travelling alone she has been left very anxious about getting on the bus again.

The seats were very cramped and none of got any sleep. Then at Buchanan Street, we arrived early - at 5:25 am, and we were asked to leave the bus, but it was wet, cold and there was no real shelter as the bus station only opens at 6 am. At 7.10 am, the Inverness bus disappeared from the electronic departures board - and there was no information about it. It came 20 minutes later. Last on the way south from Aviemore to Glasgow on 2nd Jan. the bus from Inverness was again delayed and there was no information to tell us when it would arrive, or even if it would arrive. An information board is needed at Aviemore. And I have given you two stars, because we were delayed because of an accident on A9 on 30th Dec., and our driver, Alan was brilliant in noticing that there there was no traffic coming south.

This means they knowingly sold us tickets for a service that didn't exist. At 17:25 another ""Airline"" coach arrived and the board on the bay said it was calling at Gatwick, driver told us it wasn't (he was very rude and dismissive, as if it was our fault the board had the wrong information).

Before we started the driver had a lengthy phone conversation with a colleague, not apparently about traffic conditions, and he stopped on the motorway(Fleet Services)  for around 25 minutes (as the WC wasn't working )for his meal break.  I had an early start booked in the morning and having arrived at Poole coach stop at 1850 I got home in London just before 0100.  The core problem I think is a lack of sanction or information about alternative routes. This is I understand a fairly common occurence- long delays have happened to me twice on Megabus previously.

Resulting in me being late arriving in Euston rather than Victoria as planned I also missed my concert of Abba voyage which is even more expense!! Disgusting!",18 December 2022

"Trauma and humiliation from your driverI am writing to issue a compliant about the incredibly unpleasant experience that myself and my four children had on our Megabus journey from Manchester Airport to Dundee on the 20th of December 2022 due to multiple incidences of bullying and harassment from the driver.The bus was scheduled to arrive at Manchester Airport at 12:30pm but was about 2 hours late, arriving at about 2:30pm, my children were already feeling tired, so I was anxious to get them settled on the bus. However, when it came to my turn to load our luggage, the driver started yelling about how we have too many bags, even though I was standing close to him. We had 6 bags amounts the 5 of us and these bags were all well under 20kg each as per the luggage policy. I was not given the opportunity to pay for excess luggage either, which is supposed to the available in Manchester stations. I found the driver’s demeanor to be aggressive, unkind and impatient, and I didn’t want my children to witness anymore unpleasantness, so I conceded and sent back one of the bags with my nephew that had come to see us off.When we got to Shudehill station that was still in Manchester, more passengers boarded the bus, and I was called out by the driver. He said my luggages “smelt” and demanded I opened all my bags up. He found that there were food stuffs in my luggage and began berating me for having them, saying that I was not permitted to carry food. Each and every food item in my bag were all cold, dry and were non-perishable. He was insistent that I removed all the food items, and said they were going to be thrown away. I was not given the opportunity to call a family member to get my items from the station. These food items had been given to me by my sister and are valued at over £1000! As myself and my family are still new in the country (I am an international student), I intended to use this food items to feed my children for some weeks and now they are all gone! The driver insisted that this was the Megabus policy, I was so upset and began to cry but there was no empathy and compassion from this driver!  I have since double checked the policy online and there is no mention of food within luggage, there is a policy on food in the coach and the food items I had met all the stated requirements and more.This incidence has caused me and my children great distress. I lost a lot of valuables, was bullied, and harassed in front of my children when I was still acting within Megabus policies. As a paying customer, I find the behaviour of this staff appalling and also racially motivated. I and my children are of African descent and the food stuff in my luggage were traditional foods.I want this incident to be investigated and addressed appropriately as I do not want any other person to face this injustice again. I also want to be compensated for my items that were thrown away so easily.",20 December 2022

"This doesn’t even deserve a starThis doesn’t even deserve a star.Hello,I have been using megabus for over 15 years and have never had any issues. I travelled from London to Glasgow and just completed a 12.5 hour day shift as a nurse at St George’s hospital and was really hoping to sleep on the bus so I could enjoy some family time when I arrived in Glasgow and not feel completely exhausted on the 30/12/22 because of lack of sleep.Once the the bust left Victoria I noticed that the bus driver didn’t turn the lights off. After thirty minutes I went down to ask the driver if he could turn the lights off and he said they had to see what the passengers were doing and would not turn the lights off.This is completely unacceptable and felt more like torture for 8 hours.I have enjoyed using megabus over the last couple of years and the customer service has been excellent. However this felt like abuse on a whole different level.The reference number of the bus I was on is 43/44-1399-291222-m11x-2300-Lon-gla on the 29/12/22.I look forward to your reply.",29 December 2022

"Mega bus experienceOn the 22nd December 2022 at 7:40 pm I was travelling from Heathrow airport to Manchester coach station. I was coming from abroad with my husband, the coach had turned up late. We both had suitcases that were up to 20 kg. We had our 2 hand luggages. The hand luggage that we had and went into the flight with, they said that our handbags are the hand luggages and we are not allowed to go in with the suitcases apart from 1. The driver was very rude and was behaving in a racist manner. He allowed a white man to get on with two suitcases. He then said that we have to go and buy tickets for 6 people for the both of us and later asked me to open my suitcase so he can check what is in there. Myself and my husband had to stay overnight at the airport. I have never encountered such a horrible situation before like this. I will be spreading the word to everyone to not use the mega bus service. I will also like my money to be refunded as soon as possible because I did not use the mega bus service. If this does not happen then I will be reporting the situation to Ombudsman.",22 December 2022

"Left me Stranded at M6 services at 2am…Left me Stranded at M6 services at 2am London to glasgowOvernight service. @2300 from London Victoria. Was told that due to the service being fully booked, I am not able to have the seat which I prebooked and paid extra for.Stopped at M6 toll Norton cannes, I left the bus to go to the toilet and the bus drove off with my luggage and left me Stranded at a motorway services in the middle of the night. I came out of the toilet to see the bus driving off and actually tried to chase it screaming and shouting for it to stop.Called the customer service number who said I would have to make my own way. The bus would not be stopping or returning to get me.I told them there is no way for me to leave the services as the only way would be to walk out onto a live motorway. They suggested I call the police and ask them to take me to the nearest town to continue my journey. The police said they are not a taxi service and they would not attend to help.After becoming distressed and telling the police and ambulance service I would be walking out in front of a lorry they sent help. They took me to Wolverhampton bus station at around 4am where I spent the rest of the night on the street in 0° waiting for the train to resume service at 9.45 am. Bought train ticket for £98 to continue my journey.Surely the bus driver has a duty of care to ensure the passengers are on board before driving away. Even the customer service agent didn't seem to care that I had been left Stranded in the middle of the night at motorway services.Was told to open a missing luggage complaint to get my bag back. Ive done this abut haven't received any correspondence of where my bag has been taken to or left.Still not reunited with my luggage on the 29th December 2022.Have raised a complaint but am yet to hear any resolution or even a response.I'd like to be reimbursed for my luggage and the train ticket and compensated for having to spend a night on the street in freezing temperatures. Hopefully this can be resolved so I will await their response. It is now 29/12/22 at 02.30am. Timestamped to see how long it will take to resolve..",27 December 2022

"Rude, unprepared and unreliable.I booked a bus to get me to the airport (a 3 and a half hour bus journey to then be followed by a tram) and I joined the queue to a rude old woman telling us that there wasn't enough room on the bus for everyone. No extra bus was being provided, passengers who didn't fit were just to be prioritised for the next bus. When I expressed that this was entirely unacceptable- I was told not to interrupt her speech which, by the way, continued with no new information.  The staff are unequipped  to deal with the public. The service is apparently completely unreliable you need to rely on luck or as in my case bad manners.  I had to be rude and make sure I got a seat because I had a flight to catch but there was no system in place to help just a mess and annoyed, angry people. I'd  love to say that I won't book with them again. But there are no other options in the area my mother lives, so that would be a lie.Public transport in Scotland is useless and megabus are leading the way with bad customer service to boot.

"Disappointed ☹️Booked seats and paid for well in advance. Ordinary coach supplied. No booked seats, free for all seat wise.

Dumped in dark in freezing temperaturesDreadful service. The bus I was due to take from Birmingham to Inverness hadn’t even left London by departure time. Ended up on another bus to Manchester and then another to Glasgow. My onward connection wasn’t there so put on a coach to Perth where I was dumped . Not impressed I was left for 2 hours on a Perth car park in the dark with no toilet facilities with temperature at minus 6 degrees. I was borderline hyperthermic and felt very alone and vulnerable. Horrendous experience After 2 hours company organized a taxi. I got to my destination at 3.25am instead of 10.45 previous evening. Disgusting service and it wasn’t  cheap at £115 return. Shocking service and dreadful customer experience. I wouldn’t recommend at all. Can’t even get a refund!,15 December 2022

Both journeys were overnight and passed very quickly. On our return we were offered seats on a Duplicate Service as there had been an issue with the scheduled vehicle. Consequently we arrived in Edinburgh a full 90 minutes EARLY.  Next time I will definitely book the Duplicate Service...lol.....!And by the way one of the lovely ( return trip ) drivers should be on the stage.....he was such a comedian..!Outward 19/12/22Inward 22/12/22",22 December 2022

We had to find out from a coach driver of another service, that your coach was awaiting an engineer to fix.

Earlier in May, I was on a trip to Glasgow from London, I went to use the washroom at the Edinburg stop and the driver left even after he saw me rushing out before reversing. On getting to Glasgow with a different bus, I figured that £30 was stolen from my bag I left in the bus when the driver left me. Till today , I didn’t get my money or an explanation after I laid a complaint immediately I noticed.Secondly, I had to cancel a scheduled return trip from Glasgow to London and it’s quite unpleasant I couldn’t get a refund or have it converted to credits for the next trip.Thirdly, I had a recent trip from Glasgow to Manchester scheduled for the 15th of December 10:30 pm, as expected I was at the bus station for 10:00pm but the bus didn’t show up till 11:15pm. We were all left in the cold without an explanation even an apology. The bus came and we were instructed to go in without any form of concern for the delay or explanation. I got exposed to the Cold and till today I am down with flu due to that exposure at the bus station.I have got tons of experience with Mega bus that are not really good and I feel you guys can do better with your people management skills and respect for peoples time",15 December 2022

Would like to make a complaintWould like to make a complaint. I would like a refund for my recent experience with mega bus. I was due on the 1:15am bus on 17th December from Newcastle to London. The bus was over an hour late. No notification to say that was the case. Not only that we were then told by a mega bus employee that turned up there may be a risk of potentially not getting on the replacement bus. Whole experience was horrific. And the fact I paid extra for a reserved seat. Not only that the bus that turned up was not a mega bus but a normal coach. The whole journey was uncomfortable. Really disappointing this is only my second trip with mega bus,17 December 2022

Will avoid in future.Megabus, your reply: ""We are very sorry to hear about the delay to your journey. ... ... "" did not address the real issue.  My message:  ""Night bus 40 minutes late arriving. Tracker said on-time.""  What are Megabus customers thinking when the bus is clearly late but your on-line tracker says ""on-time""?  It is far more important that the information about lateness is correct, rather than that amount of lateness in itself.  Why am I having to explain this to you?",18 December 2022

My scheduled coach from Heathrow was an hour and a half late, in-between other late coaches that were going to my destination, refused to take me, I was concerned that I wouldn't make my connection and I explained this to the drivers. When the coach I was booked on finally arrived, I expressed my concern that I wouldn't make my connection, because I had an hour and 10 minutes between my connection and I was 20 minutes behind, I explained to the coach driver I was concerned I wouldn't make my connection, he drove swiftly and carefully and as we pulled up into Bristol my connecting coach was right in front of us, he was 10 mins late in leaving, I had to dash off the coach grab my bag, to make the other coach just before he was going to get on the coach. To tell you the truth I was concerned if I would just be sitting by the roadside that night not able to get home. Both coach drivers worked really hard, all credit to them. Considering the time of year,  I think either you should have had supplied more coaches or factored more time in the schedule that the trip would take and that they would be delays.",19 December 2022

The same thing happened on my last trip (20-12-2022) the bus was supposed to leave 20:20, it arrived 21:00.

Pre-booked seat double bookedUsed megabus a few times now with no issues however the last trip I paid a premium for a front row window seat only to find that upon boarding the seat had been doubled booked and was already occupied. So after liasing with the driver I had to sit downstairs behind the driver in a very dark seat which was not ideal for a 5 hour trip. Luckily the person who had my seat got off half way through my journey and I was able to take the original seat I paid for.

So we were about one and a half hours late arriving. It appeared that the coach we were returning on had left early before the stated departure time. So we had to buy tickets elsewhere to return home. All in all it was a dreadful experience and I kindly ask for a refund please.,10 December 2022

Worst travel experienceI had to give one star cause it allows me to write a review after star. I had a worst experience with megabus. I had to go to Newcastle from Coventry so booked a bus although it was 140pounds for two people. I booked the ticket and had to wait till 7:30pm from 7:00pm. The bus didn’t arrive the bus stop i had to call the megabus and ask where is the bus she checked it online and she says that we cannot track it cause its a private service hired by megabus named prospect from Coventry to Birmingham and from there we should take megabus. However the prospect bus didn’t turn up and i said there was no bus in that stand from 7:00pm to 7:30pm they called me back and said the bus was in the station from 7:27pm to 7:33pm which was not true i said i can prove that with the cc tv footage. They said we will book you into another bus with no charge but we had to wait from 7:30pm to 2:40am till morning and they have booked it from Coventry to london so had to take extra journey and from london to Newcastle and reached newcastle next day 8:00pm. So they wasted my day i had to explain it to each and every person from megabus i had to meet to travel cause there is no reference number for my travel. They pretend it like its a charity for me. Completely disappointed and frustrated with Megabus…,18 December 2022

"Appalling Customer Services TeamWhen I arrived in London (final destination), I took the only case identical to mine. However, it turns out that someone took mine by accident at an earlier stop (Leeds). When I tried calling customer services, they were very unhelpful and, even though I knew the name of the person who took my case, they were unwilling to cooperate. Fortunately, me and the lady who took my suitcase have our suitcases now. But we swapped ours via a different service to Megabus because of our appalling experiences with the customer services team which led us to not trust Megabus. As a result, I would advise for next time that if someone has someone else’s suitcase and they know who’s it is, and/or someone knows who has taken their suitcase, your customer services team should contact them without hesitation, and it should not over an hour to convince them to do that. From my experience, it felt like Megabus wouldn’t let me have my suitcase back even though we both knew exactly who had it and where it was located. Therefore, I am unsurprisingly very angry and disappointed with Megabus in this regard.",11 December 2022

"Rude driver to the Muslim family of 4me and bf booked a late night tixket back from London to Leeds. While the driver checking our tickets, there were a Muslim foreigner man in front of us who has gotten his ticket check by the driver and ask his wife to bring the luggage from the side. That passenger represented his family to get tixket checked, but while he asked his wife to bring the luggage, they were stopped by the driver and ask them to queue from the back. He has got his tickets check, why is it wrong for his family to bring the luggage to store under the bus?Second, as they were asked to “re-queue”, they were also the last to board the bus. So, when the wife came up to the bus with 2 kids, they realised there were no more connecting seats for them anymore. They were forced to split up even though they have actually bought seats. The driver told them rudely that the original seats that they bought is not this bus, MEGABUS has changed the bus without noticing, so it is not his problem. Just go up the bus, and find a seat or ask someone to let off their seats.It was 100% saddening to see how rudely the driver treated them, as their English was not as good, the driver was obviously bullying them.",10 December 2022

Although correct with company rules it was not a good public image for the company and seemed to make many other people including my husband and I feel uncomfortable with the situation.

"So I usually don’t use MegabusSo I usually don’t use Megabus, but a friend recommended and I tried the service. It has been pleasant until my last trip from Birmingham to Cardiff. It was a horrible experience. I understand there was rail strike on that day, but I feel proper information should have been dispersed to passengers, even if not immediately but at least we get informed. My bus was for 2.30pm and I got to the pick up point(which by the way is not a very good pick up point as passengers are left in the cold or sun as the case may be… STANDING for God knows how long!!!) at 2:15pm and stood till 3:30pm, in the cold till when the bus eventually came. Please, I think a mail at least should be sent ahead about delays and any other kind of disruptions. With National express, we receive a mail that apologises and gives an estimate of when the bus will likely arrive. National express has once delayed in arriving for pick up for about 75mins, but we got a mail at 2:15pm for a 2:35pm trip and I just remained at home till the 75mins delay had passed. It would have been better if the pick up point had seating arrangement or some sort of covering from the cold. National express eventually gave 50% discount voucher cards to everyone who was affected cos sometimes these delays could not have been avoided, it’s just the manner of approach in handling these situations as they come that matters.

"Absolute joke of a company, AVOID! Use National Express insteadYesterday, booked a 17:00 Manchester to Leeds because of the train strikes. Manchester station was crazy. Lots of people there with 15.50 tickets who couldn't get on the 15.50 bus because it had been overbooked. (My girlfriend had rode this bus earlier, said they hadn't bothered to check tickets).When my bus eventually did show up at 17:30, he said he was only letting on the 15.50 people, and there were loads of them! The worker turned his back on me and I was able to sneak on... To my own bus! Got one of the last seats and there were still 15:50 people having to wait longer! Had been due to arrive at 18.10, we arrived at 19.30. 80mins late for a journey that's meant to take less than 80mins. I had a concert at 19:00 and arrived over an hour late.===Today, the journey back to Manchester, due at 11.45. Saw a woman ask if she had time to go and cigarettes at 11.45 with no bus here. The Megabus worker said ""Hurry up, be quick"" just before she asked (which is such a bad attitude towards customers in my opinion). He told her no, then said he's going for a 30min break. Must have known there would be no buses for 30mins then. Given no information about ETAs whatsoever.Eventually, a bus did show up 40mins late. Noone knew what bus it was, noone bothered to announce it. I asked the driver and it was my bus, to Manchester. He didn't bother checking anyone's tickets. Once again, there were people with tickets who didn't make it on the bus. One person wanted London and had to get off, just after we left. We actually left with 3 empty seats, even though there was people with tickets who were told there was no space.Will never ride with Megabus again.

No heating on megabusWednesday 14th December at 10pm I took megabus to Bristol. Now I don't mind travelling by megabus but this time the coach was not only 30 minutes late but it was freezing. No heating and the temperature outside was below freezing. 3 hours on a cold coach. Come on megabus. Fix all the heating on your coaches. Or I will have no choice but to switch.,14 December 2022

"UnsatisfactoryJust got on my coach from Manchester to Liverpool. The time of it: 3:35 am. Originally, I was supposed to get the London Coach at 9:25, however I was refused service on my coach, lied to and told it was the wrong coach and made to wait outside the station across the road for over 6 hours in -7°C weather. I couldn’t stop shaking and was barely able to feel my feet or my legs. I was told this was a three hour delay, but that suddenly turned into a six hour delay as the following bus also had a three hour delay. Outside there where babies, children and other adults waiting for up to 4 hours for their coaches. I rung up and all they could say was that the bus had left the station and I told her, you’re not listening, I was told that was not my coach by the driver. Yet the woman continued behaving rude and abrupt, talking over me and repeating bus times at me. Eventually it turned up, but I had to cause a comotion before a replacement was sent to ensure it was still arriving. At any given point they could have sent us initial means to get me home, like offering a taxi, but instead they refused, despite serveral requests and/or complaints There’s a reason I don’t use megabusUK. Though in this incidence I had no option but to use their service due to strikes and National Express being fully booked.",16 December 2022

"Horrendous experience!!Recently used megabus. 2.12.22. Stuck behind 2 women with speakers on talking the whole way from Manchester to Birmingham, then one got off. Other was then on phone all the way to Southampton! At Southampton driver said we could get off at drop off point or he'd drive us further to port to pick up ship. Told us it was only a 6 minute walk to the ship. He told us to go straight forward to Dock then turn left.  Mile & half later with 2 large suitcases between us and me with a Crutch!. We got to the dock to be told ship was other side of town at other dock.  Couldn't get a taxi!  Dock guy rang through to other dock to be told ship was leaving in 30 mins...Dock guy eventually got us a coach as there were 3 couples sent to the wrong place by driver. The driver also had road rage..was playing cut up with a van driver he wasnt happy with. Swearing and sticking his finger up and even went into slip road when other driver left the motorway then he swerved back to the motorway to continue the journey.2nd journer 9th Dec 22.The bus had technical issues & stalled 3 times, driver had to ring for mechanical advice. Eventually sorted.

For example Exeter to Bristol airport the stop is not at the park and ride but on opposite side of road and 300 yards towards hotel.

Genuinely lovely guy, hope you can get some recognition to him and maybe even an extra Christmas gift? Comes across as someone who does above and beyond and loves his job so he deserves it!

"bad experience on the megabusTo whom this may concern,I am writing this complaint regarding the service I received travelling from Portsmouth to Manchester on December 1st 2022. Please see the attached itinerary.During the journey, the bus had no heating and we were unable to use the charging ports. As we reached Oxford, the bus broke down and we were left waiting for it to be fixed for an hour.After a long wait, we were advised that the bus couldn’t be fixed, but we were promised an alternate method of travel and that this would would be arranged for myself and at-least 15 other people, who were all travelling to Manchester.During this journey, the driver informed us that we were no longer going to Manchester and instead we were being dropped off at Birmingham . On arrival at Birmingham  station, they were not advised of what had happened and were not aware that we were getting dropped at Birmingham  to join another megabus service later that evening.As you can imagine this was stressful for everyone. However, I’m 19 years old and this is my first time living away from home and my first time using a megabus to travel home and back again.I had no battery on my phone to call any family to let them know where I was and if I was okay. I was dropped off in a city I didn’t know and my family were left worried they couldn’t get hold of me. This, along with the company having no knowledge of our arrival into Birmingham caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety.I didn’t arrive into Manchester until 8pm, by this time it was dark and I was worried about travelling through the city to my uni halls.At the very least I would like to be compensated the cost of my journey, due to the undue stress this caused me.I appreciate breakdowns happen, but the whole situation was poorly managed.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Kind RegardsMarley Carmichael",01 December 2022

How can we book 2 ticket with the same information like same name, DOB.

The bus drivers were very helpful, we arrived at London Stansted much later than anticipated but the journey itself was good and I managed to sleep. My feedback to Megabus: Bus drivers should have access to an effective, reliable, and quick tracking service (no matter what time of the day or night is) to update any information and delays about the bus service, so passengers can have quick access to an updated and reliable information straight away.",28 November 2022

Megabus. No show v7.00 pm bus from Cardiff to Bristol did not turn up by 8.30 pm. So we found another way to make the journey. All tickets were via EMail. So contact could have been made to inform us of what was going on. Someone in the queue was using the tracker. It said 20 mins away at 7.45. Then nothing.,26 November 2022
Hours of waiting without knowing what was going onSomething broke on the coach and we pulled over a few miles from the set off point for safety reasons. The driver phoned for help and was told help was coming but it never did. We eventually returned to change to another coach and complete the journey but the waiting time was longer than my journey time and the driver could not even update us as to what was happening for most of the increasingly stressful wait due to the lack of feedback from Megabus HQ,01 December 2022
"More than value for moneyI have travelled with Megabus a few times now and for most of the journeys I have been totally satisfied. Drivers are friendly and helpful.

Cheltenham visitCoach on time and comfortable but on this occasion 3 lads got on the wrong bus . One got off straight away. The other two refused to get off as said it was not their fault they were on the wrong bus . The previous bus driver had let them on. So we were delayed an hour whilst the bus driver tried to ask them politely to get off.  He even rang the next mega bus due  to see if they could transfer but it was full as the trains were on strike. We were held up in Birmingham on the way back waiting for the bus driver at change over. I still wold travel with megabus as on previous occasions it has been fine.

The reason I say that it could have been that there was a toilet but we weren’t able to use it is because one passenger went downstairs, presumably to find a toilet and was told by the driver to go back upstairs.Found the driver to be rude and didn’t assist with getting suitcases in the baggage area.",25 November 2022

Disappointed and disgruntled customerDear Sir/MadamI am very disappointed over my experience with Megabus and the way my complaints have been dealt with recently and in the past.My booked and paid for service did not stop at my bus stop even though I was there before the scheduled time. The Bus drove pass the bus stop and did not stop. This was at 6.09am on an autumn morning. I was left stranded and in the cold.I had to seek alternative way to travel to London from Nottingham to attend to an urgent matter in relation to a bereavement in my family.Megabus has refused to refund my return fare and no compensation. I feel very insulted with their line of questioning as they have the tracker to confirm when the bus drove pass my bus stop and did not stop at all.Please kindly assist to look into the matter.Kind RegardsMs Q. Osawaru,23 September 2022
"Was a replacement busWas a replacement bus! Bus had fewer seats, no sockets/Wi-Fi, seat bookings didn’t count not very comfortable.A real shame as got to see what was inside a regular mega bus as one pulled up just before ours arrived. Even more galling as it was running a short haul trip, compared to our 9 hour cross country route. Maybe put replacements on short routes?Otherwise, drivers polite and helpful, and bus on time despite traffic: that side of things was great.Would try again.",26 November 2022

"Unprofessional Services.All my life in the UK, I only use and trust Megabus, but the last few months the delay of bus at pickup locations and also at interchange is appalling.

We were left in the freezing cold, without no shelter, no apology email, not an sms or a call for the poor service rendered and the rude way of communicating by there driver as if they doing us a favour, you are business because we choose to be loyal to your company,  and the .ost annoying part is the fact I feel you deliberately don't want to have a customer care number(s) for us to call for complaints, even the email which is the only way to get in touch with a customer care representative, takes like 72 hours before any response, so if I have an emergency, I can't even get hold of a me.ber of your team.

He treated us like we were ALL scum and made it clear from the off, he was in charge and we were to all DO AS WE WERE TOLD! Or else we would be walking to London. Even though nobody had said or done anything to him. This treatment was reported to Megabus and being appropriately dealt with. My chair couldn't recline and I have spinal problems. I'm not sure what the problem was but rather than ask the driver, as he was the ONLY driver from Edinburgh to London, I thought best to leave it and not get my head bitten off! I've suffered since the journey with my back going into spasm. One 30 minute service station break in over 10 hours is no way near enough. After the bus stopped, the driver treated a London Victoria employee in the most despicable manner. I took it he was a racist to be honest. She explained she was only doing her job, whatever had happened and he came back on the coach saying he won't have anyone stand next to his coach saying whatever it was then called her a ""funking clown""! My husband and I were disgusted!It appears Megabus don't drive Megabus coaches most of the time. We weren't in a megabus coach going down or coming back. We changed coach to stay together coming back and ended up on Millionaires Executive.  The issue here was no charging sockets and again, lack of stops at services.However, the drivers on the return journey were amazing gentlemen! This was on the Sunday 28th.

I contacted Megabus 48 hours prior to travel but had no success.  I'm a pensioner so l was dismayed that l had to rebook which cost extra money.  On my return journey in Saturday l sat behind the driver due to mobility problem.  That was okay but the smell of the lavatory was very unpleasant from Birmingham to Oxford.  The bus is okay but certainly not comfortable for older travelers.,26 November 2022

On boarding our seats were taken by someone else, I politely asked them to move only to be swore at and abused, not wanting to cause a scene and upset my granddaughter I found some vacant seats.This bus trip was as equally uncomfortable as on this bus it was freezing cold, heater controls not working again.I can confidently say I will never use megabus again.",24 November 2022

None of the National express busses were full but no megabus passengers were allowed to transfer their tickets.Terrible service. Will never use again.",26 November 2022
Appalling ExperienceAppalling. Sent a Hodgsons coach but did not inform us or the other 8 people that were left waiting for a blue and yellow megabus. There is a tiny line on the ticket that says ‘Megabus by Hodgson’. That’s it! I had no clue this meant a different type of coach to look out for.The driver obviously knew 10 people were missing from his pick up point but couldn’t care less I guess. Ruined my Christmas shopping trip with my friend. Customer service also couldn’t care less.,26 November 2022

"Please amend no refund policyI booked a ticket from coventry to heathrow. It was my mistake that I booked 2am ticket instead of 2pm. I realized it immediately after I booked the ticket. I tried to re schedule the ticket to my desired time but unfortunately there was once a day bus service on this route, so this wasn't the option.I tried to contact the customer service as soon as service hours started. I was told  about no refund or no partial refund policy.I can understand if there are multiple options of buses to choose from and I I can swap the ticket from the date and time.It's a shame that in 2022, where other bus services are far more flexible and have options of refundable ticket, there are several time of buses to choose from, this service doesn't give these options.",25 November 2022

At Bristol the driver dropped us in main road and told us the bus to Cardiff will come at 6:30 but we have to wait in this cold weather until 8:10 exactly!!!!! 2 hours and 10 minutes waiting with my little kid who was shaking at very cold weather in the main road.Then I to call my son to come from Cardiff to pick up us from Bristol!!!!!!!!!This morning my little son was vomiting a lot because of cold last night and couldn’t go to school .You should be a shamed of your self with this miserable service.

"The coach arrived late and bad customer serviceThe bus was running late. We were supposed to leave at 8.30 a.m., but due to a problem with the coach, we were forced to wait until it was replaced. Approximately a 40-minute wait. The way the situation was communicated to the passengers was awful. We were only informed of the reason for the delay after we boarded the coach. I understand that things happen and that staff cannot do much about it, but they can communicate with passengers. Everything about it was frustrating. Although I have used Megabus before, I will not do so again. Customer service is atrocious, to say the least. Megabus is not worth the hassle; I think I'll stick with National Express from now on.When I've used the National Express, there have been delays, but the customer service is much better. The staff is much better at explaining what is going on and keeping you updated. The toilet was also out of service halfway through the trip, which irked a lot of people near me. I was on the coach from London to Leeds. A very long journey. Overall the journey was uncomfortable.",27 November 2022

The bus was fairly full when we left Bristol, but as soon as we started our journey the bus cut out and broke down, it then broke down a further 9 times on our journey, a couple of times was in the middle lane of the motorway. Because of roadworks the bus took a detour which meant we were on A roads heading towards London. It was one of the scariest journeys of my life. We never knew when the bus was going to breakdown, and genuinely felt that we were going to be in a pile up at any minute.

A little hair-raising from Reading to ManchesterFirst of all the bus was half an hour late arriving in Reading for the journey to Manchester. I chose to sit right at the front which meant I could see where we were going. If I hadn't I probably wouldn't have seen all the near misses which had a few of us gasping at times. It was either a case of the bus driver almost clipping the car in front on cutting back in after overtaking or the car that overtook us cutting us up on joining the lane. But then it was £30 return. That said I got a lift back in a car to Reading.,26 November 2022

This bus arrived and we were told it was full and there was a replacement bus on the way but they didn't know where it was. Eventually we got on the bus at 20:15. We were supposed to be home for 7:30 and didn't arrive home until after 10pm which then led to us missing the last bus home as it was a Sunday and had to spend more money on a taxi to get us home",29 October 2022

I needed a ticket to Birmingham at short notice and Megabus was the cheapest at £20. Really wish I'd just paid the extra £10 to go with National Express. Coach towards Birmingham was 15 minutes late to leave to begin with and the coach back was an hour late. Had me stranded in a city I'm unfamiliar with (with nothing but my phone which was on low battery). Not only that but the online tracker just kept adding on 5 minutes to the expected arrival time. Staff were also rude e.g. ""Can't you read mate?"". Won't be using again. Hope this helps.",25 November 2022

"Missing luggageMy husband lost his luggage since on the 16th of September in Mega bus and we started writing megabus customer service immediately and we’ve written over 15emails and until now his luggage have never been found, the customer service showed zero empathy even though the event that led to the disappearance of his luggage was totally megabus fault, no attempt from megabus to locate his luggage, we were asked to register the item as missing item and we did that until now we have never heard from megabus nor seen our luggage. Avoid megabus at all cost if you can. I have sent a review here since September and nothing was done too. I’m disappointed. I will soon be taking this up with the right authorities",16 September 2022

The toilet facilities were appalling, there was urine trailing down the aisle and smell was awful. On my return journey, the toilets were out of order and no toilet breaks were offered on a 6 and a half hour journey. If Megabus is offering toilet facilities, at least ensure that they are cleaned regularly or offer a toilet break if the facilities are out of order.I had reserved a seat both ways, but the driver told us to sit where ever we wished. This caused confusion and problems with the latter passengers. There should be a consistent approach, and all passengers should sit on their reserved seats especially as we pay extra for that service.",21 October 2022

When we spend a lot for a group of people for up and down travell...and have not travelled in the ticket and no refund, no information about the delay.... Unhappy",31 October 2022

Journey from London Victoria to LeedsJourney from Leeds to London absolutely fine comfortable and clean. However we hit a tube strike day in London and the traffic was completely gridlocked causing us to miss our journey back from Victoria Station. The gentleman at reception was really lovely and got us on the next available coach. However whilst I was stuck in the traffic I’d e mailed your head office telling them about our situation and the reply I received was completely bog standard and very unhelpful . It also totally contradicted the advice we were given at the Victoria bus station! The very down side was that the bus had a blocked toilet which smelled vile and as it took us over two hours to get to the M1 due to traffic that certainly did not any of the passengers either. This all said I am assuming this was a one off situation and I would not be put off giving them another try in the future.,10 November 2022

"Late Again!This is the second time I have travelled this route in six weeks.The journey into London went without incident and arrived within a few minutes of the published time, but on both occasions the return trip was late leaving Victoria Coach Station.This resulted in arriving at Abington late, the first by 45 minutes and the second time by over an hour.This meant missing our connection and having to wait 3½ hours for the next one – not good!I struggle to understand why the service leaves late, and am very disappointed, so much so that I am seriously considering not using megabus again.",15 November 2022
"Coach didn't turn upCoach didn't turn up, no communication from megabus. As customers it became our responsibility to track down information and inform the rest of the passengers of any updates, via phone calls and twitter (coach tracker wouldn't work). We waited an hour on the street, no shelter or facilities near by, and on a winter morning. When the next coach showed up for the later 10:25am service the driver had no idea he was our replacement and that the coaches had been merged. So once again it became the customers responsibility to inform and communicate on behalf of the company. And now they wont offer any refunds or compensation as they only do that after two hours! Although I am very grateful not to have waited in the cold for two hours that is not an acceptable standard or policy for a transport service to have.",14 November 2022

We arrived at the station to find out that the seats we had paid to reserve were cancelled And the pair of us had to be separated. We asked the Bus staff for help and they completely disregarded us and said and I quote “I only drive the bus, there’s nothing I can do”So I was separated from my heavily pregnant fiancé, causing a lot of destress.And I was forced to sit next a man who was drinking 8 cans of Stella Artois (lager) all the way home.

The driver was very abrupt and rude about it and was trying to show us the terms and conditions on his phone and just said that the one extra luggage couldn’t go, as you can imagine panic set in and I just thought whAt am I going to do with this suitcase . We then put it inside our main suitcase only to be told that we should have bought another ticket for the extra bag . We started our journey on a very cramp seated bus only to look around and see the bus nearly empty . This has put us off any type of travel going forward with travelling to any airport as we won’t take any chances again , we felt that the driver could have been a bit more informative from the start about buying the extra ticket for  the extra bag.

"YanaHi,this was the first time i used MegaBus services and im quite unsatisfied, unfortunately.First of all, bus supposed to leave at 22.30, as indicated in the ticket, but it was delayed and boarding started only on 22.35. We finally moved from London at 23.00. It didn't affect the arrival time and we arrived on time, but still it was quite unexpected to have such a delay in departure.Second, when i was trying to purchase a ticket online, i was proposed to buy a reserved seat or smth like this, stating that they have more space for legs and in general are very comfortable.  In fact no other seats were available to book, so I paid 8 pounds additionally for me and husband, and when i saw this seats in real, i was frustrated, no space for legs at all, seats are not adjustable so i could lean on it and have a sleep at least a little bit. I've never in my life experienced such an uncomfortable bus trip.And last, but not least, it was a night bus and it was extremely cold ventilation in it! We literally got frozen in it!I hope my feedback will be taken into consideration.Thank you!",13 November 2022

Similar to National express - travellers taking long phone calls & loud music is not permitted on their coaches and is communicated clearly when boarding.I wish this was communicated in the same way on megabus.As I sat next to a lady that spoke loudly on the phone continuously from Middlesbrough to Manchester and I didn’t feel comfortable intervening.I would of appreciated if the driver had said something.Seats were okay, but were a bit hard.

"Basic, but flawed serviceThe bus got me from A to B which is the point I guess. And the prices are always reasonable so no real complaints there. My issues with the last few journeys that I've booked this year are that the seat that I've paid extra to reserve is in a different place and position on the bus than that on the website - meaning I've paid for an aisle seat and ended up with a window seat. Also, despite it being advertised on the website (and even on the side of buses) there's been no working phone charger on any of the last 4 or 5 journeys I've taken. Lastly on my last trip the driver stopped at service stations twice - once for 40 minutes - meaning our coach arrived 45 minutes late. I understand the need to stop at least once during a 7-8 hour journey but does it need to be that long? I don't have any more trips booked at the moment and think I might consider other options next time.",25 October 2022

"We use megabus frequentlyWe use megabus frequently.  We always try to book well in advance when the seats are cheaper because booking on the day is the costs are much greater but turning up and paying a driver is even more expensive.  Try to avoid this. We like the fact that the buses leave promptly and very often arrive slightly early.  yes, there are times the buses are delayed and I have been on one delayed 2.5 hrs by an RTC but this was beyond the drivers control and he kept the passengers informed.  He also suggested diversion routes to buses behind.  Bus dispatch drivers are very accommodating if you miss your designated bus or turn up very early, they sometimes put you on earlier buses.  I do wish the drivers had the time or technology to check everyone was wearing seatbelts like car seatbelts.  However, I do wish queuing for mega bus services in Aberdeen was more organised, as it's a massive scrum and you have to stand outside in all weathers.  I know it's not a mega bus fault but a stagecoach problem.Megabus advertise charging points and wi fi on their buses but very often it doesn't work, or the bus offside has a charging facility but the nearside doesn't work.

Backup return not needed.Wish there was another answer with N/A on it. Only booked this  for a return from Manchester to Cardiff on the 9th November because of the train strike that was announced for that day but as this was called off we didn't need to use it & used our train tickets instead. Also wish there was a way of letting megabus know that you would like to cancel the service instead of just being a no show on their piece of paperwork so at least the driver knows beforehand that you will not be there rather than hang around for an extra minute or two just incase someone is late.,09 November 2022

I’ve travelled London to Newcastle many times over the last 2 years and due to lack in money took the overnight coach for a fraction of the cost of a train. I had many reason that have resulted in me writing this, the lack of leg room. At 5’10 I don’t think I’m a giant yet I didn’t have enough room to sit normal due to the seat in front being too close. When sitting in a seat for 8 hours it hurts and was uncomfortable. The seat belt, again, another thing that really hurts and cuts into your neck. For £20 cheaper I didn’t feel it was worth 4 hours longer, sat in a seat that is uncomfortable. Personally I don’t think I’d do it again. Sorry.",04 November 2022

The only criticism I have is that because the journey starts from Newcastle the reserved seats ( I always book and pay for reservations) are invariably taken so sometimes difficult to get occupiers to move elsewhere. I think the driver should make it clear which seats are reserved. I have experienced occasions where travellers have asked for their reserved seats to be vacated and met with abuse. When complained to the driver the customer is often told to find an empty seat so not sure the value of reserving a seat,12 October 2022

"Booked Seat - shouldn't have botheredWe had booked to go to Manchester and paid extra to have seats together.  When getting on the bus, the driver didn't mention anything about the reserved seats now being 'unreserved', we had to find out by asking the passengers who were sitting in our booked seats.  It's not a massive amount, but there were a number of people on the bus who had paid for seats too.  I messaged on facebook and was promised a refund of the seat fee, but nothing as yet.While travelling, the bus floor became covered in water.  The bus driver said that it comes in through the wheel arches.  The only problem was that my husband's bag was on the floor and his clothes for the evening / next day ended up soaking.  I have a video of the water sloshing about the bus if you'd like to see it.The return journey was better, we were able to get to our booked seats, but the organisation at Manchester Bus Station leaves a lot to be desired.",29 October 2022

I would definitely use Mega Bus again.,21 October 2022
"Massive delayWe were due to get the coach at 8AM, which was a direct quicker coach. Around 8:20, we were told that there had been a ""scheduling issue"" and they were sending a replacement coach, which would be there at half past. We eventually went to speak to staff who said that they couldn't contact the driver and we just had to wait. At 9am, the next coach arrived and an announcement said we were to get that - 2 coaches worth of people onto 1 coach, which would be nearly 5 hours instead of the 3 and a half hours our direct would have been. There was no help with reserved seats, or communication at the other stops. We were told that we would get refunded but nobody has been in touch. We have tried to call a few times but not been able to get through (will email after this)",31 October 2022

"Missed bus due to error in LHR departure display boardAn error in the display board caused me to miss my 9:15am bus from LHR to Bournemouth although I was there in the station at 7:45am. Therefore I had to purchase a ticket for the 12:30pm bus. Thus I did not use my 9:15am ticket and feel that my credit card should be refunded the GBP 24.30 that I paid for it.

"Glasgow to London return is howlingGlasgow to London return is howling! Dont do it! It stops at about a million bus stops along the way. Firstly it was delayed then theres no stops to stretch your legs or grab a sandwich. The thrones an abomination, we booked a train return leg by the time we got to Leeds.

"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!I am writing to complain about the horrible experience I had Megabus yesterday. Firstly, I was shouted at by one of your workers (caucasian Male 5'9""/5'10"", wool cap, in his 30s) at Shudehill interchange at 2pm when I inquired about the timing of my coach. Thereafter, when caucasian customers inquired about the same issue, he was polite to them. I then stood at the front and leaned against the sign. Next, a new worker took over ha asked to se my ticked. I then showed him, and then he said I had to get to the back of the queue... I was absolutely confused because I was stand at the front of the queue BEFORE there was a queue. At this point, s an ethnic female, I felt absolutely attacked by the second caucasian Male at Megabus. I refused to go to the back of the queue because i was there from the start at didnt recognise anyone standing in the queue because they arrived after me. The bus then arrived 1 hour late. When i boarded the bus, it was filthy with trash and stink. This is FAR from the service I expect from Megabus. This was the worst experience I've on a coach. I recommend to avoid at ALL costs!",05 November 2022

"Good valueWe caught the Mega bus up to London. The driver was friendly and the bus was good value, so much cheaper than certain other companies. The only problem was that the toilet was blocked so we were unable to use it. The driver did however stop at a service station so that we could get off and use the toilet. I would recommend using a Mega bus.",02 November 2022
"Pleasant Surprise!First time with Megabus - travelling from Potteries to Bristol. On time, clean and comfortable, friendly and helpful staff all the way. There and back. And great value compared to a 'highway robbery' train price. I'll be back!",04 November 2022
Free Wi-Fi is a lieI do love traveling with mega bus. Their free Wi-Fi is a lie. It never works. Like never. I once asked a driver before boarding if the free Wi-Fi was available and he responded that he hoped it worked. it never did.other than that. i am cool with them.,05 November 2022
"Never againThis bus arrived on time at 11am and left on time due to get into Manchester at 4pm. I was booked on this bus with 2 other adults and 3 small children aged 5, 4 and 1. A few hours into the journey we were told that there would be delays of over 2 hours due to traffic so due about 6 maybe 7pm. Some time later around 5.30pm the bus broke down and the toilet also stopped working. We were stranded on the motorway with no food, drink or toilet. We were unable to get off the bus due to it breaking down on the motorway. No one had had anything to eat or drink since 12pm and were very upset, people did rally together to find some snacks for them. We were put into another bus and left for Manchester only to be informed 15minutes into journey that they needed a 45minute break before they could take us to Manchester this was awful and not acceptable, replacement buses should have been sent out earlier. We were told that there would be taxis to take us to our homes we finally arrived at Manchester at 10.30pm at night 11.5 hours after we left Glasgow, there was nothing not even any Megabus staff to be seen. I then had to pay for a taxi to get us all home which cost £21.  can you imagine what its like trying to keep 3 small children amused while hungry tired and thirsty.",28 October 2022

We took the bus at the time we were supposed to be arriving in Bristol, my husband got sick due to the cold we went through at that Heathrow station.We got on a crowded, hot, smelly bus.  My suggestion is that you provide quality service and respect the customer.  I paid for a service that was not provided properly.",28 October 2022
"Stranded by Megabus: Cost me £75Stranded by Megabus: Cost me £75I tried Megabus for the first time. I was not allowed to board as my (tiny) folding bike apparently can't be put in the hold without a box or bag. I tried to reason and get common sense out of the driver, after all my folding bike was smaller than a typical suitcase, but to no avail, and despite pointing out that it would leave me stranded and that a cab would cost £75 ( I wonder if the driver or Megabus have heard of the cost of living crisis?). Instead, with a smirk and sense of vindication the driver told me that was not his problem. Nothing I could say would change his mind. He quoted some small print, and sure enough, deep, deep in the small print about 4 pages in on some obscure part of the website that needs a magnifying glass it says folding bikes need to be put in a box. It may as well have said ""we hold customers is contempt: if we strand you don't say you weren't told"". I asked about a refund and he said I couldn't get one. Congrats Megabus, you have now made money off my back without providing a service and double sold a seat, costing me the price of the original ticket, plus £75 for a cab.",05 November 2022

"Retuning home (Valerie Rimmer)…My first part of the journey was a nightmare as I was leaving from Exeter Honiton Road at 4.15am, daughter dropped me off and had to leave for work, only to find it was the wrong side of the road, no indication anywhere to say Bristol bus left from opposite side of the park and ride. I got the 5.15 am into Bristol the driver was really helpful along with a colleague who had got on the coach obviously on his way to work. As we approached Bristol the driver asked his colleague if he knew what time the Newcastle coach left as he had a lady who had missed her connection in Exeter, he told him 7.20am, this man then rang Stagecoach to see if there was a possibility of delaying the coach for about 8 -10 mins to enable me to catch it, thankfully they did and I was able to get the coach. The man also said in the event that they had to leave he would arrange for me to get the Manchester coach, then the Leeds coach, but alls well that ends well, so from the bottom of my heart and my daughters a huge thanks to both the driver and his colleague, unfortunately I didn't get their names but I am sure you will know who they are, also the driver of the Newcastle coach for holding back. As I say my only criticism is not making it clearer which side of the road the Bristol bus leaves from. Many thanks",29 October 2022

Whilst your fares are good your punctuality is poor. The previous week I booked a ticket for my daughter on mega bus from Leeds to Newcastle but again the service was an hour late. I’m afraid I’ve lost confidence in Megabus and find Flixbus punctuality far better.,01 November 2022

There is no process for excess baggageThere is no process for excess baggage. I arrived with my wife and son with extra bags. I had already purchased an extra ticket as I was aware that I had more bags than permitted on the ticket. However the driver asked us to simply buy 4 more tickets which means I bought a total of 8 tickets for 3 passengers. Since the bus that we were boarding was already out of the sale window I was forced to buy a ticket on the next bus. This means if a genuine passenger wanted to board the next bus he could not as the tickets would display as sold out wherein in reality we would never show up for the bus as we were already enroute. Your company should consider international passengers plight at the airport who are left at the mercy of the drivers decision who mistreats passengers and insults them in front of other fellow passengers leaving the rest of them to be ponder what exactly is happening !,26 October 2022

Cancelled busWe were waiting for a bus which was due to leave Edinburgh to meet a bus at Perth to take us to Inverness. This bus was cancelled and we were told that a replacement would be found and the bus to Inverness would be held at Perth until we arrived. The replacement bus duly arrived and we pulled into Broxden 10 minutes late. As we were turning into Broxden our driver stopped to allow the bus with Inverness on the front to come out. Speaking to the inspector at Perth he advised us that as far as he knew our bus from Edinburgh was 30 minutes late and because we were on a replacement bus he had no contact with that bus. In the year 2022 I find it difficult to believe that a driver would not have a mobile device to contact the depot  at Perth . This was completely unacceptable.,18 October 2022

"Six hour trip was actually seven, but we were not toldTook a stagecoach from Liverpool to London since there were no trains due to a strike. We were told that the travel time was six hours. However, due to Megabus' policy that drivers must take a break of at least 45 minutes every four hours, our trip ended up being over seven hours long. I am not criticizing the policy, I'm glad you value safety, I am criticizing the lack of transparency to your clients. Setting expectations and living up to them is an elementary business concept.",29 October 2022

Regrettable, I had to request to cancel the booking and seek a refund but this was turned down. I was told that by Megabus policy, I cannot cancel a ticket, and I cannot get a refund.As a student that is struggling to cope with studies, I appealed to the Customer care rep but she insisted.It looks like I will lose a whole £23.62 to Megabus because of its policy that is not customer friendly.I hope the management take a second look at such policy and amend accordingly in line with international best practices.",31 October 2022

Unfortunately the bus broke down as it neared London, obviously that couldn't be helped, but the information about how long we would have to wait for our replacement bus was false. At first the driver was told we would have a 45 minute delay but once that time had passed we knew it would be considerably longer. I felt for the driver as passengers, especially ones missing flights at Heathrow, became more irate.If we were given a realistic time of how long we were going to be at the beginning people could've made alternative arrangements earlier and avoided upset.The driver did apologise when we got off the bus in London, approximately 2 hours late!!!",18 October 2022

I will never use Megabus again. I will be going back to the National Express.",03 November 2022
Cramped ConditionsSeats are far too close to each other making it difficult to get into them.  The aisles aren't much better either. No room for bags as the overhead storage is too narrow to get anything stored.I used to travel regularly with Megabus but I'm sure extra rows of seats have been added. Now I prefer to take the train rather than being too close to people coughing all over me.  Not for me anymore 😢,22 October 2022

Vacating the bus at a reasonable stopMost of he drivers are very pleasant !They run on time mostly and of course the dreadful diversions in Edinburgh don’t help !I live in the north west of Edinburgh and travel every  week to Dundee and back. I can’t understand why I can’t get off the bus at Queensferry st. at the west end on certain buses as when I book my bus it does not tell me it’s going straight to the bus station. It can take me another hour to get home from the bus station as I need to get two buses from there !I realise that the tram situation is causing problems for buses near  the bus station but a little compromise would be appreciated.If the bus can’t stop in Queensferry st. can it not stop at the bus stop before the Dean bridge to let the people who live at the west side of Edinburgh a chance to get home ?,02 November 2022

No apology for coach delayFirstly...the coach was delayed and we didnt get any notifications or phone call or messages to state this. When u check on the website for status it said its on time??? Totally unorganised and very appalling. People wasnt given any courtesy help or advice what to do or where they can stay...just hanging around in the street when it was freezing for 4 hours.,19 October 2022

UNFAIR TREATMENTI was at Buchan bus station for my trip to London on Sunday at 1pm but I got to the ticket check to board on the bus and I was told I couldn't carry my 3 boxes because of space allowance but it was going to be weighed and if there is space I will pay for the extra boxes. I waited patiently making me the last person to board on the bus but while we were still waiting for the guy checking the ticket to come check our boxes he told the driver to go as he thinks we were not ready.We were at the park early our boxes were not weighed and he just told the driver to go. It was an unfair treatment and we had to use the train which was outside our budget. Ticket is yet to be refunded,30 October 2022

"Never againA wasted day thanks to Megabus/National Express.06.30 bus from Norwich to London. Suppose to arrive at 10.20 at London Victoria. I had the appointment for 12.00 - allowed myself  plenty time to be on time. The driver apparently must have hit something and as a result the mirror was broken. We had to wait an hour to repair. When we approached London, I asked the driver to get me off the bus earlier as I saw the building from the bus, we were a few yards passing the place, and it was around 11.20 so still would have made it on time. The driver refused. Pretending to be apologetic and compassionate all the time, apologized 20 times which make my experience even more bitter. The bus finally arrived at London Victoria at 12.00 o'clock.  Wasted day at work, wasted time, money, a lot of frustration. Missed my appointment, the next available being in January. Never again. I will drive next time.",26 October 2022

Firstly bus parked on other side of road and no one knew so we were stood there an extra half an hour until the bus driver told us to get on, the bus we got on wasn’t even a mega bus it was a coach then once we got to the second stop in Middlesbrough he told everyone going to leeds to get off the bus because it was over booked obviously everyone refused so we were sat there for about half an hour until we set off again then at leeds everyone was told to get off the bus and get on a different one which no one was told about the transfer and there wasn’t meant to be on I was meant to get into Manchester at around 7:30 ended up arriving at 9ish",09 October 2022

Bus service disruptionI liked the kindness your drivers. I didn't like the lack of communication about a disruption. As soon as the ride I was supposed to catch didn't arrived in Aviemore I checked your website looking for an alert. There wasn't any. My mum and I waited for 1 hour and a half before a bus showed up. The driver solution was to take the next bus to Perth and then change to Halbeath (my final destination was Edimburgh airport). Unfortunately there was no room for us in the next bus. So We waited another 40 minutes. This time there were seats for us and the driver offered 2 solutions:  arrange a transfer from Perth to Halbeath or stay on the bus until Edimburgh bus station. We chose to stay. Our flight was schedule for the next day so we had plenty of time. I advise to update your website more promptly.,12 October 2022

"No assistance at the bus stationMy bus from Manchester airport to Bristol arrived 20 minutes late. At the bus station there was no one to assist passengers (my ticket specified that a supervisor would be on duty all day!!). I had no idea whether my bus was arriving or not. When it arrived it said ""Cardiff"" and the bus driver wasn't sure about the bus going to Bristol because he was going to Birmingham. At Birmingham the bus driver changed and the new one said at last ""next stop Bristol"". I wasn't sure until then that the bus was taking me to my destination.

Late late late and not great......................The scheduled journey was late by over 40 minutes leaving Manchester.  The driver them told me to sit anywhere without a number on the seat but all the seats had numbers so that was pointless as passengers were arriving with tickets with numbers on them so I had to keep moving around the bus. Irritating.  Then there were zero stops on the bus so no bathroom breaks. Arriving in London was very late and the driver had to stop for a changeover literally ten minutes from the station which added another 27 minutes to the journey.,16 October 2022

"Driver a bit rude about seat reservationsWent on a return journey- the inbound trip was perfect other than being just over an hour late (knock on effect after the bus broke down the previous night). The issue was with the outbound journey- we had paid for seat reservations & our journey started in Glasgow. It was a third party bus that turned up to take us, myself & my friend waited for everyone else to board since we had seats reserved, but when we boarded the driver was shouting at everyone to just take the nearest empty seats & when we (others explained) that we were looking for our reserved seats the driver stated there were no reservations on the bus. We pointed out we had paid for our seats and the driver got pretty rude and said that was impossible, there was no way we could have paid for reservations etc. and just to go sit down or get off the bus. We'd booked seats with extra legroom because my knee gets stiff, and someone else on crutches had to slowly & awkwardly make their way upstairs because their lower level seat they'd booked had been take, and the person sitting there wouldn't budge.It was a bit disappointing,  megabus usually honors seat bookings on third party reservations so not sure why this wasn't the case. Megabus were quick to issue us a refund with no fuss after we enquired which was good.Will still travel with them cause its convenient and well-priced, just a bit frustrating that the reservations aren't consistent with third party coaches",17 October 2022

When we goHi,We purchased one day four tickets through you to visit places in London.Out of our 4 days, we planned to go on your sight trip the last day and the next day we were coming home.When we got into your bus, the ticket checker plus two drivers informed us three different times for last cruise boarding times. One said the last boarding time is 6.40 pm, another said 6.50 pm and another  7pm. So we reached London tower bridge stop exactly 6.30 pm and reached the pier by 6.35pm. But the lady there said they had a boat breakdown and due to that things got changed,  and the last boat for the day has already left and there's nothing they can do.This was very disappointing as we missed our cruise trip in our holiday with kids. We paid £118 for this, but not at all worth.Finally with all disappointment, we again went back to the bus stop to catch a sightseeing bus to go back, as we were informed by the drivers as well as your online info the last bus is at 7.40pm.

Happy Italian available but more could be done onboardThe service being available at all is what I believe makes it a good service. It allows me an opportunity to visit my partner in Inverness at an affordable rate. I would stress that the seating is very uncomfortable and not very functional for a long distance journey which for me was around 10 hours in total from meadowhall to Inverness although I would say the city link bus from Edinburgh to Inverness was much more comfortable.   I did reserve an extra leg room seat for my journey from England to Scotland but decided not to use it as it sealed like a crowded position and the table wasn't much or a table more a strip of plastic. The toilet door was also faulty and banging through out the journey which started at 1:40am making for a very uncomfortable experience. I would suggest a vending machine on board,15 October 2022

Newcastle to Edinburgh / Random replacement bus with no explanationMy booked Megabus journey was from Newcastle to Edinburgh. A non-branded bus arrived and there was an announcement that this would be our bus. A few of us asked the driver what happened to the actual Megabus (I recall paying extra for a specific seat) - he said he didn't know. Since then I've had no explanation from Megabus as to what happened to the Megabus. The driver was great and the replacement bus arrived on time - but would hesitate to book again.,02 October 2022
Bad ccustomer serviceI bought a ticket I wanted to change j couldn't I called your customer service and the advisor said he's not allowed to do I have to callback in the morning which was too late so I wasted almost 25pounds for nothing because I end up not using the ticket.,14 October 2022

A fair priceWas a good value trip but was comfortable and despite arriving late got us to location at time expected. Only thing for me is the toilets were dirty full of water on floor and no water in addition no sanitiser and would make me think about booking again for this reason as if partner needed toilet on journey would be a lot more difficult for women as was like a shower tray in there.

"Megabus to the rescueI had originally booked and paid for a train ticket to get me from Leeds to Manchester Airport. A rail strike put paid to that idea. Megabus was my only other option. They didn't let me down. I was nervous on so many levels about possible things that could go wrong. Coach not arriving, it breaking down on route, getting caught in issues on the M62. I was so happy and relieved to arrive on time with no problems from start to finish. I will definitely use Megabus again.",01 October 2022

"Smelling toilet and Driver from hell!!!!!HelloI would like to make a complaint about the state of the toilet on your bus. I have used your company many times and I have never experienced such filthy toilet area! I am sitting here at 1608 London to Swansea unable to use the toilet as it smells so bad. I understand others use it but it's the start of the journey! Also, the driver where do I start!!!!1. Telling customers put your seatbelt on you know what happened to Diana !!!! Is this happened twice!!2. The bus was 20oc and when asked politely to turn on the air conditioner he said there's no air conditioning. My husband that has heart problems was wanting to get off as he over heated. After 20 minutes later it came on.3. erratic driving braking and generally being uncomfortable thank god another driver took his place in Cardiff.4.  then we saw him have a disagreement with passengers at the front. They said he was on his phone at traffic lights (this is illegal in the country, he became distracted messing with paper work, being sexist towards the poor lady in the front of the bus and he walked away putting wo fingers up at the bus after altercations with passengers.  I'm so glad my husband was with me, and I was not traveling alone.I never complain but I felt something needs to be said and at this point felt uncomfortable to use your company againRegardsK Morgan",17 October 2022

The bus was set to leave from Glasgow heading to Aberdeen (on the 17th of October) at 17:10, and it didn't show up. The 17:40 service came and departed before ours did. Eventually a replacement bus came an hour late, whilst passengers were all standing outside waiting in the rain. There was no apology from anyone, not even an acknowledgement from the driver about the delay. My elderly mum who had just spent a week in the hospitals took a while to disembark the bus, and as we're slowly getting off the driver rudely told us ""it shouldn't take you this long"" not knowing what my mum had just gone through. Zero apology or consideration. An absolute pig. Avoid Megabus at every cost. This is the thanks you get for paying for their hefty salaries.",17 October 2022

"Another very bad experience with Megabus.Bus booked, seat reserved. Departed Heathrow 45m late for Birmingham, arrived nearly 2 hours late, a different substitute bus to that advertised so my paid seat reservation was irrelevant as the layout is different and the driver told me you don't offer refunds for reservations in such situations. You just have to sit where you can find space, next to the dirty and very fragrant toilet at the back that I discovered also has no toilet roll.

"I have been a customer for over 10yrsI have been a customer for over 10 years. From when it was new. On average, I have never had a concern about the return service from Manchester to Birmingham 10 years of travelling! On point. As we know the motorway has its set backs, delays, issues, closures you can't blame Megabus obviously for some. Some of seats foam have worn, leaving the hard edges pushing into the sides of your leg thigh, so for big people like me having to put up with an uncomfortable pressure throught the journey, unless I fall asleep, which I do. Again the backs of the seat for a gym lad is a fitted shape, and on the small side,  muscle dosent give way, nor dose the seat, aside from this minor aggrevation, the drivers, 97% do a great job at being safe, and smooth, and finding the quickest route through traffic, which always seems to be the case, so with a vehicle that big long heavy, its no easy task!  As we know companies will spend time and money sourcing suitable drivers, and training them, and its clear they receive good instruction, and direction whilst on route. A brilliant service to the UK commuters. However gone are the days I could source a ticket for three quid! High fuel prices, and as we see there is growing competition! A needed service, with high standards, although the seating at the coach stop on Brunell St could be better, but would it last at the hands of destructive yobs..Sometimes this coach services is very busy, and pressured, if staff at the station, and customers are not focused  people can miss thier coach when thiers more then one coach in the que, which was witnessed the other day, on the 15th. Drivers on average can show compassion and when thiers been a mistake they are happy to help you out, obviously they have to always excersize caution, as thier is people that are professional, at taking advantage of others at our cost! The drivers are people human, aside from our inability they do a good job! Alahamdulillah. My statements are an accurate account of 10 years of having the liberty to use this company. My opinion, based on my experience, its a friendly, organised, easy going service. ☆☆☆☆☆Not forgetting on one occasion the service was let down as the driver did not show for what ever reason, the company paid for everyone to recive chauffer driven service in Private Hire Taxis on the return trip to Manchester, you couldn't ask for more, sadly the same happened on national express, the following week a set back, we where sent by train, and the lack of direction, and amount of hassle, and the train journey being fully packed out was really a horrible experience.",17 October 2022

If I will go out from the bus then he will leave me.My wife was so thirsty and couldn’t even talk at all. Completely dry her mouth and last 9 hours we both had not good or drink at all. But this driver has time to have vape. He did stopped somewhere which I don’t know exactly but he was smoking and when I approached to him he was telling me that megabus police and law that’s why he couldn’t let me out even though it was in the megabus stop.Inhuman decisions are been made by this company.,17 October 2022

"Good outward journey - not so great homeward one.Comfortable outward journey. Bus left on time and arrived on time.However, our bus home, although very comfortable, left a little late and then seemed to take a very circuitous route through Edinburgh to get us home. It took 40 minutes to get from the bus station to the Barnton Roundabout. This meant that the bus arrived over half an hour late into Dundee. The bus was supposed to carry on up to Aberdeen and there were a lot of people waiting for it. Only on arrival, did the staff let everyone know that the bus would terminate at Dundee and there wouldn’t be a bus for Aberdeen until 6pm.If the staff had allowed us to board in Edinburgh, even five minutes earlier than they did, it would have helped enormously. There were three of them, chatting, laughing on their phones, drinking coffee etc. Whatever they were doing, it looked very unprofessional. Needs addressing.",13 October 2022

"We have used Megabus for 5 journeys in…We have used Megabus for 5 journeys in the last 2 months. Getting on the bus in Aberdeen is disorganised, confusing and unprofessional due to the stand not being signed and the difficulty in finding someone who ‘know’ or ‘cares’. On 3 out of 5 journeys I’ve had to use the toilet facilities and clearly they have not been checked before leaving the depot as on two occasions I was the first to use them. I would have thought that trays for snacks and drinks would be on long distance buses but there are not always, and being 4’10” I need foot supports which again were lacking on 3 out of the 5 journeys. Now I’m a pensioner and absolutely appreciate the free travel I get in Scotland. But you did ask and there were definitely more paying guests on the bus than pensioners like us. All that said I have found the drivers helpful and pleasant.",15 October 2022

I was told by the driver to purchase an extra ticket for the extra hand luggage, which didn’t make any sense to me. Getting to the website there was about £28 for extra seat (hand luggage). I have been waiting tirelessly with my flight delaying and missing the coach booked before. This was after 9 hours of landing and here I was thinking I would finally get to rest my head on the coach because it’s been a very long day. I wasn’t allowed to board the coach and I am an international student traveling from Nigeria with no where to sleep, so please any reasonable response as to why the system is like this?Because it was very frustrating and I was helpless.",11 October 2022

Buses not turning up has been unlucky for me. No compensation no apology from megabus.Sometimes left at bus stop with no information.  Of course there are times when megabus can't do anything but they should know what wrong and text me to let me know.,01 October 2022

"Cleanliness, communication and professional attitude cost nothing16th and 17th October (scheduled 1:30pm)  2022.Return trip from Cardiff to London:The 9:15am bus up to London was filthy. The toilet was awful and had no facilities for washing hands.The return trip was delayed and staff at Victoria were not accessible to inform passengers as to the reason for the delay or of the expected departure time ( they chose to remain outside the departure area where the public isn’t allowed).I realise that this is a budget bus service but good communication and customer service does not cost money. A little consideration for folk trying to get from A to B would go a long way.Finally, our driver back to Cardiff from London spent a fair amount of time honking his horn and shouting at other drivers. I realise that driving on busy roads can be frustrating but his hot-headed attitude was frankly disconcerting, not to mention unprofessional.On route back to Cardiff he kept sighing and slapping himself to stay alert. This, along with his random outbursts of half-arsed out of tune singing became quite irritating to be fair.I can honestly say I’ve never experienced a driver quite like it…the word unhinged springs to mind.This was my first experience with Megabus. It got us to and from our destination but lacked the cleanliness, professionalism and communication that can elevate the reputation of a company.Megabus have a word with your staff!",16 October 2022

A taxi back cost £114.60 between 2 couples, Megabus has no out of hours contact number, i had nil notification that the transport was not turning up. Awful circumstances, i wont be using the service again after this.

Lateness of MegabusI have been using Megabus for 8months now and have not been disappointed with it not until this month October. I have been disappointed 3 times out of the 4 times I have used it in this month. Just today October 14 the pick up time from Newcastle was 2:10 but it pulled up at 2:50 without any excuse or even apologise. Same thing happened 5th October the bus came 40mins late also to Newcastle picking point. It's quite frustrating planning your time and coming out early just to miss it completely. So yes I am quite dissatisfied with Megabus of late.,14 October 2022

"Unreliable and poor customer communications5.25am departure did not show up, despite being shown constantly as ""on schedule"" by the coach tracker. Two other customers, trying to get to Heathrow and very anxious, managed to get hold of Control who told us that the coach had broken down and there was no alternative being sent. There was another coach at 6.25, also showing as on schedule, but clearly that system is unreliable. No way of knowing whether the 6.25 would run, or whether it had any room for passengers stranded by the non-appearance of the 5.25. I had to get to my destination so I caught the train at considerable additional expense, as well as being late. I applied for a refund but was denied as it was a less than 120 minute ""delay"" (I think 120 minutes is a cancellation, not a delay, but clearly they do not agree and I'm sure it's in their terms and conditions somewhere). I'm aware of the adage that you get what you pay for, but I haven't even got that!  Really poor customer service, poor attitude, poor communications. I'm giving them a 3 because usually I've had few problems, but clearly there's no resilience in the system and when things go wrong, they have no back up, not even to the extent of simple communications! And the customer bears the brunt. No service and no money. Be aware!",10 October 2022

Too many times to not sayI have travelled twice in the last month and both experiences as bad as each other.The first the coach arrived over an 1hr due to driver issues and missed my transport from Sunderland and the second I paid for seat and then had to transfer bus during the journey.

I can now see why megabus probably sometimes make the buses too hot, due to one person who has something wrong wth them, who feels the cold and makes a massive fuss about it and makes others suffer in torture.The staff are polite, though.",07 October 2022
Need for better serviceTo begin with there was utter confusion amongst passenger when queuing up to board the buses as one queue was formed for two buses due to leave around the same time. There were no instructions given either verbally or in writing . When retrieving luggage from the luggage compartment a random person had to come and help me get my luggage as it was in the far corner of the compartment .

"Helped me out in a tight spot as I…Helped me out in a tight spot as I needed to get to London to run the marathon and the trains were on strike. The time of travel suited me as I had to work on the Saturday morning. My only concern was that the bus was about 45 minutes late and there was no update on the website or app to confirm a delay. The travellers didn’t know if we had missed the service or even if it was coming. We checked with the information stand at Warrington bus station but they had no tracking information either.A beautiful bus eventually turned up with our number on it but the driver said it wasn’t ours. About 5 minutes late an older bus arrived. That was ours. I had booked a seat (seat 9) but the model of bus that arrived didn’t have the seat I had booked, so I was allocated a different one. There were a few spare seats near the front but we were told we couldn’t use those as they were broken. The driver held up a broken seat to show us.Once we got going, the journey was trouble free. A few delays due to traffic and accidents on the motorway but we arrived safely.I would definitely use Megabus again if I was in the same situation. For me personally, a stop in Wigan or St Helen’s would be good but Warrington was my only option and I had no choice to use it on the day and it did the job. As I booked a week or so in advance, I got a really good price and could reserve a seat. I noticed the price increased quite considerably closer to the day of travel.",01 October 2022

"An excellent service that was efficient…An excellent service that was efficient and superb value for money. I travelled from Glasgow to Aberdeen and back on the M92 express service.The coach was tolerably comfortable, the journey was smooth; but at £1 each way with my Over-60's Travel Card it certainly beats other modes of transport for value. I think the full price would have been £12 each way - check if you're not sure - but that's still a very low-cost way to go. And the journey time was only around 3 hours each way, so the standard train journey time is similar (because the bus I took was non-stop). Take a book to read, or just savour some of the fairly pleasant views en route.I'd have given 5 stars if the toilet on board had been properly cleaned - but I expect that this was the fault of a lazy and inconsiderate passenger rather than Megabus. It's certainly not the driver's job, and I would guess that the small toilet was probably pristine at the start of the journey. Outwards there was wifi with internet access available up to just past Dundee, then it seemed to stop, I'm not sure what happened. On the return there seemed to be no internet access at all (only limited email online) so another small minus point.

Late leaving Liverpool.30 minutes late leaving Liverpool so I felt a little vulnerable as a 61 year old woman waiting at the bus station alone at 3am.Lots of roadworks on the motorways en route so consequently arrived at London Victoria Coach Station over 2 hours late. Not good when I had my granddaughter hanging around for over 2 hours to meet me off the coach.Coming home the coach was 35 minutes late leaving London Victoria Coach Station because the driver encountered road works on his way from Birmingham and arrived late. He had to (by law) have a break before he could leave. Arrived back in Liverpool 1 hour 10 minutes late (3.30 am instead of 2.20 am).This is not so much a criticism as a heads up. Roadworks mean delays. Book with this in mind......it's not the drivers fault!Other than the delays I can say that the coach was clean and comfortable and the drivers pleasant. I would still travel with Megabus again.,03 October 2022

I suggest the company should always collect phone numbers if passengers and communicate delays or changes whenever they arise.",11 September 2022

Really good service …Really good service and very good value. I was wary as the prices were so much lower than leading coach service. However I was very impressed and will definitely use Megabus again. The only drawback for me was not having at least one other drop off point when already passing through a large city as it meant I had to make my way through Birmingham centre to the outskirts when we had already come through where I was heading for which is very frustrating.,01 October 2022

I got there and was told to buy a new tkt. And I would be refunded for the tickets thay i had bought earlier. Mega bus should refund me. I will not use megabus again.",02 October 2022

"Booted off the busWe used the service from Manchester airport after our honeymoon, it arrived over half an hour late which we were willing to look past as traffic can’t be helped but We were kicked off our bus at Leeds and then taken on a separate coach to Weatherby for some reason to then be put on a third coach to go to Middlesbrough arriving an hour and a half later than expected. Was ridiculous and annoying since we have never had an issue using you before.  We had reserved seats which we now realise we shouldn’t have bothered doing and spending the extra since it was like musical chairs going from each bus to the next, we can understand traffic but when the trip went from a direct route to 3 buses for someone who gets travel sick it wasn’t ideal.",06 October 2022

You expect a USB port to charge your phone when you’re paying that price and spending nearly 7 hours on a bus. Will go back using national express in the future",02 October 2022

No space to move, I felt very claustrophobic as the passenger sat next to me had his legs wide open and spread across my seat and his own.

A First Experience of MegaBusThis was my first experience on MegaBus.  The bus was clean including the loo and it stayed that way from London to Glasgow (To be fair there were only a dozen or so passengers for most of the Journey) . The bus arrived over half-an-hour late so I missed my planned train connection to Wemyss for the ferry to Rothesay.  Fortunately the later train (also running late) just made the last ferry.  The late arrival was partially due to heavy rain for part of the journey but the long smoking breaks of the second driver and the bus having to return to manchester to drop of paper work forgotten by the driver first time around didn't help.Other than that the journey was comfortable.  I would certainly use this value for money service again.,30 September 2022
Service was smoothThe service was good and the process was seamless,27 September 2022
"ReviewI love the prices that megabus give for their journeys especially long haul journeys however quite a lot of my journeys have been delayed due to issues with the engine/battery etc and when I have had to get onto another type of coach for 6/7 hours maybe more if delays occur, there has been NO charging ports or WIFI which makes it hard for me to contact family. I feel like for long journeys mainly, there should be charging supplies and wifi.",09 October 2022
NiceThis  is  Nice Bus,10 October 2022
Long journey no break stop betweenLong journey with no break stop inbetween. I asked the driver where we are when I saw people getting off as I have been asleep. The driver was being sarcastic saying where are we? We are in England and didn’t give a straight answer which was no need for It. Driver don’t speak loud and clear like on National Express where they tanoy clearly where we are. Bus toilet was smelly and horrible. People on the bus was noisy. Arrived into Leeds half hour late. I think I rather get National Express next time as they are more professional and better customer service.,01 October 2022

"Travel during rail strike not the bestPre-booked my ticket the week before my journey due to the rail strike scheduled for 1st Oct, glad I did as there were massive queues at the bus station.  Bus was late to leave as driver had got stuck in traffic in Aberdeen trying to get to station.  Only those with pre-booked tickets were allowed onto bus as staff advised those waiting that all seats were booked, which appeared to be untrue as there were several empty seats for the entire journey to Glasgow.  Driver was then in a rush to make up time and on 3 occasions in the journey he braked abruptly causing those in board to be thrown forward.

"Not a good service this time around.Normally my journey with yourselves are great, but unfortunately this time it was not a good experience. After booking and paying for the front seat, the seat I had booked the recliner element of it was broken which meant every time the driver braked the seat would move forward, with then made a 3.30hour journey, which due to delayed end up been a 5 hour journey( no fault of the driver) made it very uncomfortable and end up suffering with a very sore neck for days afterwards, due to seat movement with it is not meant to do.",30 September 2022

He put us on danger, I went with my daughter 1 year old, obviously I wasn't happy, and apart from a person who was drinking beer all the way to Bristol, the driver would tell me to f,,,k off when I asked him for help with my pram, absolutely disgusting behaviour that in any company would definitely end up with this driver dismissed.",07 October 2022

No Coach No InfoPrecooked a ticket on 0745 from Aberdeen to Glasgow. Turned up in good time and began to line up at appointed stance. Was second in a line that grew to around 20 people. Departure time came and went and drifted into the distance and still no announcement as to what was happening. Eventually the bus we believed to be ours started up and driver announced it was the 0845 to Edinburgh. All attempts by myself and two drivers to locate a manager or supervisor were in vain. Eventually the driver of the 0845 to Glasgow took us on his own volition. So we arrived over an hour late and slmost a week later still no response from Mega bus stagecoach,30 September 2022

"Excellent service.My husband and I travelled with Megabus from Glasgow Buchanan Street to Edinburgh airport on 28 September and booked seats for the 3am bus. This was the first time we had travelled with Megabus and we were very impressed. The bus was immaculately clean, very comfortable and the driver extremely helpful and polite. On my return journey, 5 Oct at 6pm (think it was the same driver) again a very pleasant journey and the driver so helpful. I was delighted at the cost of the transfers which saved me  a lot of money in parking fees at the airport. Will definitely use Megabus again and highly recommend it. Well done to Megabus & your drivers. Many thanks.",28 September 2022
Impressive Customer ServiceHad an issue with a journey. Reported the issue to customer service. Customer service replied within 48 hours and the matter was quickly resolved.Customer service the way it should be.,17 August 2022
"Myself and 5 others waited over 1 hour…Myself and 5 others waited over 1 hour for a bus from Exeter to Bristol, nothing shown on your tracker and no explanation from the driver who did turn up. I believe it may have been a ticketing error and that our bus was not even scheduled for that day! No shelter or anywhere to sit at the bus stop!",18 September 2022
Pleasant journeyNothing happened except the bus was a bit late arriving. Otherwise a pleasant comfortable journey.,18 September 2022
"Megabus experienceGood on outward bound, poor on return.Drivers were pleasant and helpful.",28 September 2022
BLOWN AWAY! BY THE EXCEPTIONAL SERVICESuch an amazing outstanding service was really blown away . First managed to book the timings of the bus wrong and when we called them 1 day before as a good will gesture they gave wowchers for new journey.  Than our bus was delayed by 2 hours and we could not go on the app to change as would not let us do it. On arrival to gatwick from spain we were so stressed but the driver was so accommodating and said hop on when we told him flight was delayed. Honestly cannot thank this company enough and have to say exceptional customer service. I would def book with them again journey was perfect and bus very comfortable with USB ports too and a toilet. Tickets cheap. What is there not to like. Thankyou megabus so much for going over and beyond with your service and helping 2 females travelling alone . God bless you.,05 October 2022

Bus was delayed for an hour,30 September 2022
Great Value for a long journeyWe were looking forward to our holiday in Edinburgh and found the cost of the journey and ease of booking excellent.  On our journey to Edinburgh we had lovely drivers however the charging ports were not working and the seats we had booked and paid extra for were not the ones we requested! This was the same for the return journey so we were quite disappointed about it. Also the drivers on our home bound journey were abrupt and not very friendly. I would use Megabus again but wouldn't pay extra to book seats.,25 September 2022

"Portsmouth to BirminghamMy journey from Portsmouth to Birmingham was going alright until Coventry, when the bus had a leak in the tire at the bus station. It took three hours to get a different coach, to travel onwards however this coach was also soon parked by the side of the road and this also took three hours to get replaced. So I was delayed six hours, in total, just between Coventry and Birmingham. My return journey went alright though.",16 September 2022

Asked for a refund or at least a credit note as out of pocket £60 but was refused! Also, on another occasion my daughter used the bus. She handed her free bus card to the driver who said it wasn’t valid (she had just received it the day before) and charged her £22 for the fare. Thankfully she had money!! Would not recommend Megabus and will not be using again!!",30 September 2022

"Coaches late every time, charging for reserved tickets despite no reserved seats, coach broke down on m1, never any apology or correspondence from Mega bus the companyWhy ask people if they want to reserve a seat and pay for this if there are never any reserved seats on coaches and they are taking peoples money for nothing? The last 3 mega buses I have got have been between 30 minutes to 1 hour late. The mega bus I got from Derby to London today was nearly one hour late and then stopped for half an hour at a services and then broke down in the middle of the M1. It felt extremely unsafe as lorries were flying by and the whole coach was wobbling. There has been NO APOLOGY or communication from mega bus about this incident despite the fact that there were 38 seriously effected people on that broken down coach. To have not even sent out an email or an apology for this incident is appalling. Those of us that could fit on another mega bus that happened to be passing by (20 out of 38 of us) were crammed on to this second coach on a dangerous hard shoulder full of furious passengers who has also been held up waiting on the hard shoulder for us. We arrived in London 2.5 hours late with no correspondence from Mega bus whatsoever.",03 October 2022

I was the last woman. 3rd trip , whohoo only 15 mins delay. 4th trip- substitute bus arrived over hour late. Broken toilet had not been removed at london. AWFUL stench like travelling in a festival toilet or sewage truck. No reserved seats, no legroom at all. Thankfully, after3 hours we reached B'ham and were transferred to a proper megabus. Cant fault the staff, very apologetic every time. But cant rely on it to get anywhere on time.",01 October 2022
"TerribleWas messy. I get that the weekend was busy but it was poor that y’all couldn’t manage the situation effectively. Cancelling people’s trips, not providing alternative buses.

I always try to get the direct bus with no stops but recently I've found that despite booking that bus, the bus still the stops at Perth and Dundee. I appreciate that things change on the day but it would be nice if all this  was made a bit clearer. Otherwise, great service, nice bus, pro drivers.",30 September 2022
Hugely satisfied travellerHaving travelled with Megabus before I had high expectations and suffice to say I wasn't disappointed. The bus departed punctually on both occasions and the seats were very comfortable all throughout the journey. The fare from Leeds to Hull and back was a steal at £3.30 each way and the driver was both courteous and professional all throughout. Would not hesitate to travel with Megabus again.,30 September 2022

Day JourneyThe majority of the tripe as excellent but sadly the bus Dundee to Edinburgh seemed to be a substitute vehicle. It was particularly cold in the bus and another passenger who obviously felt cold as well asked the driver to put on some heating. Sadly he did try but being unused to the vehicle was unable find the heating. It was really cold in the vehicle and drivers should be made aware of how to operate the vehicle before setting off. The driver was absolutely fine as he was sitting in an area where fortunately the sun shine through the window keeping him warm. The driver did try his best but to no avail. Thank you,27 September 2022

The driver was vv good, a mechanic came out and we moved on but the door continued to be a problem at every stop.

My friend and I are pensioners, one with chronic arthritis and we were left to sit in a cold bus station until 11.30 at night.

Seats are comfy enough, driver or assistant is nice, etc.On the 1st of October I took a coach back from London to Bristol. Coach came in 45 mins late, had a contract coach. Leg room is abysmal, and the coach got upto 31 degrees inside it.Overall, make sure you check if youre on an actual Megabus and not one contracted out, else expect 31 degree coaches and crap legroom",01 October 2022

Asked to confirm this and the driver rang another colleague and confirmed this.This was worrying me for getting to hillingdon with my daughter for 10pm and so I decided to send an email to see if we could catch the earlier bus from Victoria.The email was replied to within the hour and said Victoria was open as normal.Again, I asked to confirm this, which they did.God the bus at Victoria as plan, but if I hadn't sent that email, we wouldn't have got the bus back, which was obviously a worry as nothing on the day after due to the funeral.I know this was a one off occurrence but make sure you all know the exact collections and routes",18 September 2022

Driver was excellent but bus very cramped, no leg room ,seats uncomfortable. As bus full no where to spread out. Bus not fitted with wifi according to driver. If this bus is regularly used on this route - direct to Edinburgh it needs to be made clear no wifi available.Would travel again on megabus, but on double decker where I can book seats and it stops  even though cannot go anywhere on stops, doors are opened, fresh air and can stand up to stretch legs and back.

"Got me where I needed to beNot the most comfortable experience I have had, seats would be more comfortable without the seat belt buckle digging into my thigh, gladly the passenger in front of me didn't adjust his seat as I would have lost my knee caps. Too many customers trying to take too much luggage causing the drivers unneeded stress and not enough room for drivers to unload bags safely between coaches. Always seemed to be too many people trying to get on, leaving people behind  at stops. Which then caused delays.On the positive side, you got me where I needed to be very cheaply and now fully appreciate what it's like for sheep and cattle to be transported.My 1st and last time on a coach for such a long distance.",30 September 2022

Long journey without a stopMega Bus was ok but it was a 9.5 hour trip to Edinburgh and apart from picking up passengers it didn’t stop once for a break.As my other half got off the bus because of the long journey without a break to stretch your legs she fell over causing serious bruising and grazing to her right knee so I think you need to have a short break especially on long journeys,23 September 2022

"Good, cheap, easy travelGood easy travel, bus broke down on m62, no fault of the drivers, he kept us informed and we were picked up by another mega bus and on our way",17 September 2022
"Chaotic and stressfulThe experience was quite chaotic, because all the buses were running very late and there were no information updates at the bus station and the customer service office was closed. Live tracking on the website was not updated for my bus as it was saying my bus was on time but it didn’t arrive until much later. In fact I had to join a previous bus that was delayed by 80 minutes. Two buses arrived at once without any destination place written on the bus and some people who had already travelled a long way were asked to get off one bus and join the other bus. They all started pushing to get on, along with the passengers who had been waiting st the station for their late buses. There was no sense of order or anyone controlling things. My advice to improve would be that the megabus office should be open, or if not there should be a member of staff to advise customers. If there are delays the website live tracking should be updated. The staff should give priority to those who had been waiting longest and check people’s tickets, rather than allowing a “free for all”. Once on the bus, the journey was ok and took the expected amount of time. However I didn’t find it comfortable as the seats curve up slightly at the edges with hard ledges so they are not really comfy. I know this is very negative but then again when I consider the cheap price of the ticket perhaps it is bearable.",02 September 2022

Running across this busy road to get to my connection l fell my full length in the middle of the road with oncoming traffic just moving forward . If it wasn’t for 3 kind men stopping the traffic it may have been a very different outcome. To be honest l haven’t felt right since, l hurt my knees, my back, my wrist, have scratches on my new glasses and suffered from the shock of it all . The Megabus driver was going to report him as he should have taken us to the other side . All in all it ruined my lovely break and l wouldn’t use the service again.

Urine was filling to the brim and this was for the entire journey.Upon arrival at Birmingham, there was disorder. Passengers were standing in a large group and getting angry with the supervisor. It was distressing and chaotic.Due to traffic accidents, protests and the train strikes the bus arrived 3.5 hrs late to Manchester. I was dehydrated due to not drinking water in fear of needing to go to the toilet which was not usable. A 5hr 45 min journey was over 9 hrs. That is a long time without a break and access to a proper toilet. This is deprivation of a basic human right. What made it worse was that because we arrived late to Manchester, the toilets at the bus station were closed!There were other issues too. The bus almost smashed into a car in front. It was a lucky escape. Some people were drinking alcohol on the bus and some people spoke so loud when on their phone you could hear their entire conversation. Rubbish was everywhere and no bins to be seen. The bus was packed for every leg of the journey.Get the train. If there is a train strike, cancel your plans. Never ever get the Megabus. You have been warned.",01 October 2022
Bus never cameBus never came. Had to take a different bus and instead of arriving in Manchester at 2.45am I got back at 8am. They also had too many passengers due to buses not arriving and people had to stand. Absolutely awful and I want a refund,18 September 2022
"The actual experience of travelling was…The actual experience of travelling was excellent and I will continue to use megabusMy issue however is with the attitude of the bus driver to a black family who he prevented getting on the bus because they were late and the amount of luggage they had even though they were going back to their own country after staying hereHe was rude, shouting, quite disrespectful and really didn’t put megabus on the map for customer serviceI emailed megabus 5 minutes after we left the station but I have yet to even receive an email to say you are looking into my complaint",27 September 2022

"Jobsworth putting comfort of passengers secondary to £8 reserved seating revenue.An entire half of the bus was made up of reserved seating you had to pay for in advance - despite only 4 people being sat there, and no air con on the bus, driver INSISTED that everyone else hd to pack like sardines in the back half so that it was incredibly stuffy, leaving half the bus empty for no good reason.Absolute jobsworth, especially given the announcement at the start there would be 30-40 minute delays (making the journey particularly long and uncomfortable - would have been nice for everyone to get their own row (which there was plenty of space for, and which megabus drivers have always allowed in my past experience when there is space).",30 September 2022

A suggestionThis bus service is reliable and on time. However if you are traveling from Glasgow to London or visa versa- the trip would be more enjoyable if thru passengers could get off the bus at some of the stops. I had to sit for 9+ hours which is very bad for circulation in the legs. allowing thru passengers a 10 minute walk around while getting the luggage of departing/boarding passengers would be helpful,25 September 2022

Glasgow to Leeds on MegabusTook the Megabus from Glasgow to Leeds as an alternative to the train which were due to be on strike. Although the trip was 6 hours the time seemed to fly by. The seats were comfortable and after the distance travelled the bus arrived in Leeds barely 5 minutes later than advertised. The cost was cheaper than the train would have been and the journey time was similar. I would recommend booking seats if you do not want to be sat upstairs at the back of the bus. I would definitely consider using Megabus again in the future.,15 September 2022

"Extra soldOverall it was a good experience, the bus was clean and, even if it departed late, it arrived on time to my destination. However, i did not like the fact that the bus was extra sold and that we were told that, even if we had a ticket, we could have to take another bus if the passengers of a big group traveling with Megabus (and taking more than one big luggage) would need the place. I don't understand why the company risks to sell more seats than they ones they have available, and why some are treated with priority. I managed to sit, but the uncertainty of having to take another bus   was present all the time.",20 September 2022

The wifi was an absolute joke didn’t work well due to low speed no connecting whatsoever and coming back from the Oxford to Manchester both charging docks was out of the order mine and the persons behind so couldn’t charge my phone or laptop and the wifi was the same very poor connection!Certainly I will not use the mega bus services never again!!!

"WHY BOARD THE EDINBURGH BUS FOR GLASGOW VIA PERTH.Our outward journey to Inverness from Glasgow was most enjoyable. On the return journey we arrived early, enquired if our Bus was on time and what bus stance (3). We duly waited at stance (3). A Bus arrived showing Edinburgh on its destination Plate. This bus left and we continued waiting on the Perth bus . After some time we inquired at the teminal desk  and were told that we should have boarded the EDINBURGH BUS!!!!. There was no information given out informing to board the Edinburgh bus via Perth to Glasgow.The controller was most unhelpful informing us that there were no seats available for the next few buses leaving us to make other arrangements at considerable cost.ALL IN ALL A VERY UNPLEASANT JOURNEY HOME.For information.Reservation no(C2)16/17-4247-180922-CM90-1115-INV-GLA-/SUN SEPT 18TH 2022 AT 11-15",18 September 2022

"Great Service. Well done MegabusGreat Service at a very reasonable cost. It was easy to book, we chose and reserved our seats with extra leg room for only £2 each (each way). Bus was clean and seats were comfortable.  Bus turned up on time on our outward and return journeys.  Friendly driver and co-worker. Unfortunately due to road works and heavy traffic on the M6 and M5, the bus was delayed somewhat but this was no fault of the driver, who still got us to our destination safely.  However, we were able to track our journey both ways (as was my son and daughter) who were meeting us, so they knew exactly what time we would be arriving.  There was a toilet on the bus (small but adequate) for our comfort. All in all, a pleasant experience (despite the delay). Well done Megabus, we'll definitely be using you again",22 September 2022

I was ready to pay extra to reserve the seats for three of us but there were only few seats open for reserving. While boarding bus, we were told to use seats at the top floor and those behind first 10 rows. If we would have known about it before we would have cancelled the ticket and opted another bus so that we could have a comfortable seat and sleep. During the return trip the bus was late for about 1 hour and we were not even given some drinking water and a comfortable space to relax.  The driving especially for the return one was really good which deserves an appreciation.",01 September 2022

"Relaxed and enjoyable experienceHad a great experience, as usually l drive everywhere and enjoyed relaxing. It was hassle free.  Journey down to London on 18 Sept had to change bus as toilet not working and went from double decker to single decker and no longer had front seat which l paid extra to have and also wireless charge not working on first bus. It was very intermittent but didn't work most of time.  Journey back on 21 Sept l nearly didn't get on bus as it had Glasgow on front and with it being my first experience on megabus l thought as the last stop on my ticket was Newcastle that's what it would have on. I'll know for future but may want to write something on invoice to let customers know.  They were so many buses coming in at that stop.  I'll definatetly be using again as really enjoyed it.

I am yet to find the audacity of the driver to check my luggage. This luggage had just food items and my personal belongings, he told me I could not travel with the luggage. This driver refused to let me on the bus. I have checked the company's policy and nothing of such was published to the public. This driver deliberately wasted my money and time.

Can't fault the prices at all, very good value.Coach was clean but from where I sat (near the front) you could smell the waft from the toilet which was unpleasant, and there was not much legroom (I'm only 5'5"") so I felt cramped by the time I was halfway from London to Cardiff. WiFi didn't work and there were no fold-down trays, so working on my laptop meant I had to place my bag on my lap and balance the laptop on that. I used a different company for the return journey.",15 September 2022
"If I could give you 0 stars I wouldIf I could give you 0 stars, I would. My journey from London to Manchester was HELL. The bus was not a Megabus, but was hired from another (inferior) company and was old-fashioned. It had no USB port's and obviously no WiFi was available. Because I had so little battery, I had to turn my phone off so I had enough power to call a taxi when I got back to Manchester. I had to effectively sit in silence for the entire journey as I was alone on the trip. To make matters worse the toilet was ""broken"". As this has happened on a previous trip, I have learnt that ""broken"" translates as ""can't be bothered to clean it"". As a result, we had to keep stopping at services, adding well over an hour to the journey. We therefore got back into Manchester at 10.50pm instead of 9.30pm. Not good enough. I was on the coach for 7 hours. I could have flown to New York in that time!",14 September 2022

Bus from gasgow to AviemoreBus from Glasgow to Perth - toilets had not been cleaned and were in a disgusting state.Change over at Perth we moved from a Mega Bus to a single decker City Link and my wife and I could not get a seat together for a two hour journey due mainly to people bring cases on board and occupying a seat with them. Our first time using Mega Bus and I would certainly be more selective in future the bus from Perth to Aviemore was not to the same standard as the Mega Bus. I noted that on the return journey the driver came out and lifted luggage into the hold which obviously did not happen at Perth,19 September 2022

"Choose Megabus over the train. It's just better!I'm done with using the rail network. Trains are just too expensive and unreliable in modern UK. The Megabus is a fraction of the price and gets me to cities almost as quickly as a train would. I previously paid just over £200 for a return ticket to Manchester on the train whereas the Megabus cost me £26 for the same return journey. The busses are modern, clean and comfortable and an awful lot quieter than the trains. Free wi-fi and charging points are a bonus. The wi-fi on the bus again much better than the train. Above that, the staff of Megabus have been brilliant. Thank you MEGABUS!",19 September 2022

"Outward Good Return Far from good.This was a return journey booking. The outward journey was fine our driver was polite helpful and very professional. We were delayed 30 mins due to a puncture and needed to change coaches but overall the Journey was fine. The return leg however was not as good. The return driver did not engage at all with passengers to the point of appearing beligerant, he did not assist elderly passengers with loading luggage and had dreadful driving standards. As a retired transport professional I was shocked by the overall journey he repeatedly drove too fast approaching junctions and then braked very hard. He at one point almost hit the vehicle in front. This journey was operated by Parks of Hamilton.",16 September 2022

Coach debacle. done a review so dont know…Ive already done a review so dont know why you're sending me another. We travelled from Hull to Finchley Rd on friday 16th september. We were waiting around 50 minutes just outside Nottingham when the driver announced there were no drivers so they laid taxis on. We were crammed into a cab with a large lady who was very loud on her phone all the way to london. The driver was following his mate but had little idea where he was taking us. I want to point out the debacle was in no way the drivers fault. They hadnt been to london before. It was rush hour and so crowded because if the funeral. We got to our destination eventually ( 3 hours late) and missed an important conference leaving me very upset and anxious. No communication between driver and passegers. No heating on coach. It was very cold. I will not be travelling with you again.,16 September 2022

"Not really happyWe paid extra for specific seating as the booking process wouldn't allow moving forward wothout seat selection, the company sent the wrong bus after already being late. We spent 5 hours on the bus from Glasgow to Manchester without a stop while facing two other passengers, (strangers) without any leg room or personal space. The aircon was on full making it a very cold journey despite the bus being fully capacitated.",17 September 2022

While on the very busy motorway he under took cars drove right upto cars in front in the 2nd lane and I mean right up and not within safe stopping distance at all, many times. He also drove in the 3rd lane which I thought was not possible due to the size of the double decker?? I could see everything from the seat I was in at the front top deck and felt very anxious the whole journey.",14 September 2022

The bus was delayed by 30 mins already but the megabus announcer said it's outside the station then after I waited  for 2 more hours the bus finally came and after boarding we were immediately told the flush in the toilet inside was not working which for a long trip with 3 more stops is a major inconvenience.,18 September 2022

"Very Bad,Very Bad,The bus was late, we tried to take the earlier scheduled but late operating bus but the very rude driver refused to honour us seating together to keep the first two rows for himself for some reason. He literally kicked us off the bus when we demanded seating together as we paid extra to reserve seats to sit together. Then we waited for our own bus which was late 35 minutes but the staff who called himself a manager in the station was not so kind to us either.Being kind don’t cost us, so I highly recommend to watch out your staff performance",16 September 2022

He told me I was not allowed to use my phone whilst I am sat behind him because it will distract him.  Yet on the journey I could hear other passengers loud telephone conversations and another passengers' music volume was also loud. I have a disability and he negatively triggered my conditions.  I asked him for his name at the end of the journey.  His name was Gaz. He was annoyed because I wanted to know his name.  I did not feel comfortable throughout the whole journey because I felt embarrassed due to the way he spoke to me in such a threatening and aggressive manner.  I do not feel confident to use Megabus again.,31 August 2022

"Megabus BreakdownUnfortunately my Megabus from Perth to Halbeath Interchange on Fri 2nd Sept broke down and, due to the major delay, I missed my connecting 747 bus to Edinburgh Airport which, in turn, meant I missed my flight back to Belfast at 8.10pm on Friday evening. Being unable to afford an overnight hotel stay, I ended up wandering around the airport overnight until my rearranged flight on 8.30am on the Saturday morning. A disappointing end to an otherwise lovely holiday in Scotland.",02 September 2022

Terrible companyTerrible company. Booked a coach from birmingham to heathrow to catch a flight. The bus came an hour late but was full after just a few people getting on so i was not allowed on along with others. We were told to wait for the next bus which would come after 30 minutes. This bus then took over an hour to come. Ended up missing my flight. Will never use this company again.,18 August 2022

"Good valueMegabus is great value for money. Comfy seats cheap reservation prices and if you get a megabus they have charging ports. I always travel Sunderland to Bristol/Cardiff regular and don’t really have any major issues . For the money it really is good value. Only downsides to megabus is sometimes you will get a replacement bus which won’t have reserved seats which you pay extra for and doesn’t usually have charging ports. Also a couple of times the toilet on the coach has been extremely smelly which is unpleasant when on the bus for such a long time. Only other problem is sometimes if you are running behind schedule due to traffic (nobody’s fault) the drivers will still insist on having a chat with the other drivers and a cigarette and won’t rush , other than that the drivers are genuinely friendly - a lot more nicer than the miserable ones you get on local short journey buses and the price is unbeatable. Would definitely recommend megabus if you want a convenient chilled out travel and want to avoid the nightmare and prices of trains and I would also recommend reserving a seat as they range from £1-£3 extra and can have the comfort knowing you will always get the seat you paid for.",27 August 2022
"Never never againNever never again. I was supposed to take the bus to go to manchester but it got delayed of 3 hours and I lost my flight. Furthermore, there is no refund service for the ticket you buy so they just made me lose money and they didn't even care. Awful company.",30 August 2022

Over all experience it's not the mega bus I'm used to stop standard slipping as it will result in your annual forecasts it's a slippery slide go do the swings or rounderbouts you won't loose rev nue jUnfortunately when I got the bus from Sunderland it wasn't a mega bus even though I booked with you their was no charging points or WiFi as normal you will know I have made many journeys all over UK from Scotland to London and many more airports bseasides other cities however if this persists I won't be able to use you anymore as it's imperative I stay in contact with my family and work as I travel I'm an ex soldier captain and require oxygen withought Comms or charging points a six hour journey could turn fatal for me so it's important for everyone to know where I am in the journey aincase I need help so please address if it's not bus advertised when booking I must know in advance so I can inform family thanks for your concern please address and our journeys will continue another misshap like last bus and I will have to go back to nationwide busses sorry but must think of my health and accessibility by my friends and family I use the bus because it's the only time I can get out to see the cenary and not the ceiling of my bedroom,07 August 2022
"Worst service and rude serviceMy mom and granny was traveling back from London Victoria to Edinburgh. Since my granny need special assistance due to her age, they combined the luggage in one bag (trolley) which was the same when they traveled Edinburgh to London. The drivers on the return was very rude and refused to take the bag. They also took out the weight including the frozen grocery they picked from London. Even after taking of stuff from the bag which then was lighter refused to take the bag and were constantly asking them to get off the bus.When they travelled the from Edinburgh they never faced any issue but why is this on their return? Why was the drivers not seeing the situation where the other person was assisting the elderly?If I had to know this was the treatment my mom and granny was supposed to get, I would have never booked with Mega bus. I don’t look forward to even travel with mega bus anymore.",31 August 2022
"Disappointing JourneyThis was my first time traveling with Megabus. I found the booking really easy and i liked the timings of the coach. Unfortunately the journey was not great. I booked my seat downstairs ( lone female ) so i could be near the driver. I booked seat 79, that was ok, leg room was ok, I had nobody sat next to me BUT the smell from the toilet was awful. I heeled on as long as possible but had no choice to use the toilet.  To my surprise the toilet itself did not smell at all it appears that the smell was coming from the vent that runs along the coach.I booked the morning coach so it would give me an extra evening in my destination but somehow the coach was 2 hours late. We did leave half hour late but not sure what happened to be so late. I usually use another company and these have never been this late even with 2 rest breaks! Because of this experience, I will not be traveling Megabus again.",02 September 2022

I have found that the seats seem a lot closer to one other since covid, not sure if it's different busses or the seats have been moved that was on April, the last journeys where a bit more comfortable . I have recently started booking my seat as it can be difficult to get a seat on a packed bus. I suffer from Arthritis and find it difficult to get upstairs on the bus so I normally sit down stairs bus i was not able to book a seat downstairs, so I had no choice to book upstairs to make sure I got a seat. I would like to see more seats available for people who suffer from mobility issues and a step to go on to the bus.

"Shady Business PracticeI don't often post reviews unless I feel that they are well deserved.Sadly I can't recommend Megabus to anybody. The website is set up to take your money and offers no way to cancel or amend your booking online. I made a mistake in my booking that was due in 35 hours. I realised within 20 minutes but was simply unable to do anything. I immediately send an e-mail to Megabus who reply the next day and tell me it's now within 24 hours of the journey so I can't amend anything, tickets are nonp-refundable, and I'm SOL.For £20 it's laughable... clearly a shady and dispicable business practice. There is nothing preventing Megabus from implementing an automatic online cancelations/amendments process with a reasonable grace period for genuine mistake - just like the law requires airlines to. This is clearly by design, their payment/order page is NOT CLEAR on their non-refundable ticket status (for ANY reason, even your own death).Judging by the operation and practices of this business, I'd stay clear. If you must, watch out for their 20KG suitcase limit travelling to the airport - as airline checked baggage limit is often 23KG - Megabus will likely try to fleece you on this for a quick and easy £10, what choice would you have to pay up, other than to miss your flight?",03 September 2022

"Cardiff to London - Improvement needed on signpostingFirst time attempting to use Megabus. I’m afraid I can’t tell you how my journey was as I never managed to get on.  Booked Cardiff to London for 19 August 2022 due to the train strikes.  Stood by shelter indicating megabus stop (there was no information other than this), well before departure time but transpired that I was at the incorrect location.  Realised too late that the boarding point was at the other side of Friary Gardens.  Can do with much better signage which wouldn’t need that much investment.  Cost of ticket was good value but I was NOT the only person that missed the same bus that day!  Several others were also unwittingly waiting in the same spot.    ☹️Anyone planning to use this service provider for this route PLEASE ensure you are waiting on the main road by Friary Gardens 👍I ended up rushing over to Sophia Gardens to catch National Express instead as the next megabus bus was 2.5 hours later.  🙈",19 August 2022
"Excelent service on a weekend with train strikeThe service was mostly on time. There is plenty of legroom and the seats are comfortable. There is plenty of room for luggage. I am very happy with the trip. I took the bus instead of the train because of a national train driver strike, but after using this bus service, I don't see any reason to travel by train at all.",19 August 2022

There was no phone number to ring and customer services was out of hours.l was going to try and find alternative transport as I did not know if it was going to arrive or not and then it started raining with no shelter at coach stop.When it did arrive we had to change coaches in Bristol and more delays as luggage compartment door was faulty.I think you want to get your act together and think about your passengers,01 September 2022

"My bus journey on the 3rd August…My bus journey on the 3rd August Inverness bus station to Edinburgh airport via Citylink was without a doubt 5 starts, my return journey on the 21st August (14:33) Halbeath park&ride to Inverness bus station was an absolute disappointment. The female driver had to be prompted by me to actually let me know the luggage compartment is full and my suitcase will need to go in the back door of the bus, the bus was late over 12 minutes which was not marked on the online info large screen, the bus driver didn't communicate why we were stuck in aviemore for almost an hour to us sitting upstairs for sure and I had to go straight on citylink page to find out the reason, this should be stated on the bus tv screen, the driver had for sure stressful day with totally full bus so I don't blame her when she twice hit and drove over the curb in Inverness to the point it caused commotion between passengers.",01 September 2022

"Generally good but some issues need addressingGenerally the journey was good and although the bus was slightly late leaving the time was made up.Our biggest issue was with the drivers behaviour. On two occasions they listened to v repetitive and irritation music on their phones on loud so the whole bus could hear.  We were near the front and so we suffered particularly as a result of this.  Quite why they did not use headphones I do not know.When the first driver took his break he then proceeded to take his shoes off and lie across a whole row of seat with his feet on the first seat of the row opposite.  This did not create a good impression and I think that they should be told that this is not acceptable behaviour. Other than that they were friendly and helpful. It would , however, have been useful if they had advised at the beginning of the trip when and where they proposed to stop for the toilet break and when they were stopping to change drivers.",21 August 2022

"This journey was perhaps one of the worst I…This journey was perhaps one of the worst I have ever undertaken.  I have travelled world wide.The bus was packed due to industrial action. Approx 150 person and perhaps more due to changes. All I know was this  bus was near to full capacity.No breaks thoughout my journey to Glasgow.. final distination Dundee.That meant that this amount of people, (more , if you take account  of new passengers boarding on as others left)  were expected to use 1 toilet over a 10 hour journey. In a fast moving vehicle.1 designated stop was apparently cancelled cos bus started late at Victoria. Over 20 minutes, so to make up time the crew chose  no stops except to pick and drop.I asked to go to the toilet which was only 20 yards away and was led to believe that departure was imminent . If I went to the toilet the driver said I would be left behind as there were no stops at all , since  apparently 1 toilet on this  bus met the needs of the 150+ travelling Public !We left 20 mins later!  He  had pointed out only a few passengers to me, to ensure his statement that bus departure was a  only a couple of minutes away from departure. He must have been aware that there were a number of passengers still going to board in 15 minutes.I could have used the toilet nearby   well in time !Suffice to say I am making enquires  with Trading standards, post covid 19 whether this number of people should all use 1 toilet and whether this is normal  by any standards.This was my last time with Mega bus, normally travel via train or National express.",17 August 2022

I used a mask most of the time. Perhaps 'going on holiday' relaxed my guard.I was suddenly too ill to catch the booked 06.45 Return on 27th, and have had to forfeit the £50 paid, on your travel terms.

Got to the rearranged bus stop and waited with other confused passengers. The bus which was scheduled for 9.30am didn't turn up. We had to wait for a later bus scheduled for 10.30 to let some of us on due to the delay and that was only after a few people complained to the driver.

It was a long evening that started at 730pm for a 7.50pm Bus London Finchley Road to Derby. To give a short version of events. The coach was late about 40mins … but when it did finally arrive at minutes to 9pm …. The coach driver DID NOT STOP at the Finchley Road stop. My mouth fell open its was unbelievable!!We where stranded! Several phone calls to a Megabus helpline made it very obvious that nobody knew what was going. I was told 2 coaches where on their way. Which of course did not arrive. The one that did arrive hour later which we where advised would be the one to rescue us  said they could not take us either.Quite incredible! I was amazed at how poor this service was. I was shocked.After much complaining, Mega bus booked a taxi at 1040pm to take us to derby as clearly no more coaches where coming.So disappointing. On my return journey I decided to book another ticket as I lost faith in taking the last bus back in. Case I was stranded again.Megabus refunded my fare following my complaint but did not refund the extra ticket that I had to buy which I think under the circumstances they should have.The only good thing I can say is my return journey was relatively smooth only 15mins late for pickup which is bearable.Much work needs to be done on customer services.",04 August 2022

Seriously the WORST BUS I’ve ever been…Seriously the WORST BUS I’ve ever been on. I’ve been travelling with buses for the last 15 years. Ive been on more than 150 buses since i take at LEAST 10 per year. This was my first time with megabus. I cannot believe how uncomfortable this bus is. I’ve been more confortable in a normal city bus than in this 12 hour bus. I’m never booking with megabus ever again.,22 August 2022
"Pathetic experiencePathetic experience, booked a trip to Derby from Reading via London. Bus didn’t come(waited for more than 2.5 hrs post departure time, had to book train tickets to reach London and catch the next bus. Highly disappointed by the service too.",22 August 2022
"front is not the best!we had reserved the first four front seats well in advance at a total cost of £12.00.  unfortunately, all were taken by other people and when asked to please vacate they refused so we had to ask driver to intervene which he did successully.  two of us are tall at 5.8 and 5.7 so really suffered with the smallamount of leg room which for a 5 hour journey was awful.  looking back, there was much more leg room for seats behind.  lastly and very importantly we dont recommend this service for a long journey like ours as the toilets were so very very very dirty with an awful smell of urine which prevented us from using them at all. no fun at all with kids believe me.",22 August 2022

Worst journey everI travelled from Glasgow to London and it was the worst journey ever in my life I book with megabus as there was no trains running due to the strike action and I needed to get to London for a funeral. I would have gone with national express but unfortunately they had sold out the day I needed to travel. It took about 11 hrs from Glasgow to London in that time there was no refresher breaks or meal breaks at all. Normally on a national express u would have this to stretch your legs and get drinks and toilets break. But megabus no nothing only stops we had was to pick up others at there stops or to let off people who had reach there destination. My son is diabetic and due to not being able to eat or drink he became ill by the time we had gotten to London. It clearly states that if your journey is more than 5 hrs then there will be a meal break well I can tell you this is not the case at all! If you do decide to travel then I would pack loads of food and drinks to last you your whole journey. Honestly not impressed.,22 August 2022

"Decent bus, decent staff, seat reservations are a sham sometimes.Used mega bus three times now. From my experience, buses are always clean have good  functional AC, and every seating area on the bus is spacious and supports charging your phone via USB ports. Impressively some buses even support wireless charging (on every seat again.) Staff are maybe not the friendliest in the world but are efficient and I have seen them solve multiple disputes speedily. It’s a shame that due to the way the company behind the staff handles things, lots of complications can arise with passengers fighting over non-existen seat reservations. Sadly in the heat of the moment frustration that should be taken out on the company itself (which is responsible for said problems) is directed on staff members who don’t hold any responsibility for what has happened. Even so from personal experience staff have a very impressive steadfast resolute approach and truly carry out their jobs well even under the duress caused by overselling tickets e.t.cI would like to emphasise just how awful the company itself is; sometimes they sell excess tickets even after the bus is booked out and this can result in some passengers not having a seat for a 6 hr journey and longer. Additionally, they offer people to pay extra for non-existent seat reservations, and from what I have heard getting a refund is an arduous task which many people struggle with.In short good buses, decent staff, but the company itself seems all to willing to financially gain at the expense of some of its customers.",22 August 2022

Moreover, our seat is ridiculouly the magic number that does not exist on the bus.We have to stand for a while to figure out what to do without a care from the driver. Not even an effort are seen from the busdriver to find a seat for us.In conclusion, we are pissed off.We paid extra for reservation, My partner found a seat but I have to sit on the bus's lower deck floor.

"Don't take megabusThe reviews tell you all you need to know. Mostly bad reviews. Do yourself a favor and get another coach company.I got there half hour early, the bus was already there, parked on the bay.It was white and unmarked, so no megabus sign anywhere.Then it's time to board and the bus is still there, lights off, unmarked, no driver at the seat. No warnings, nothing.Now it's 10 mins past the boarding time.People are losing their patience.Finally, I see the bus driver inside the bus, but at the back. On his phone. Sitting down. He's been there this whole time.This POS was just gonna sit there for another half an hour if we hadn't knocked on the bus window and asked what's happening.He was really rude and said he's taking a break!! We all said ""the bus is late"". He just said he needed his break because whatever.And that it was gonna be another 20 mins.He goes back to his back seat. Then, 5 mins later, this POS c.nt turns the bus on and decides it's boarding time!!All the other people that heard him say 20 mins are out to the toilet or shop, so they probably missed the bus.He then comes out and talks to one passenger and says he can board 1st!!The other people that were complaining to him were made to board afterwards!!!Oh, and the usb chargers weren't working.The bus kept making a beeping sound too, which was annoying as it was night and we wanted to sleep.So, avoid megabus.This was from Bournemouth to London.",16 August 2022

"Curate’s Egg good in partsCurate’s Egg, good in parts1. Cardiff Bus stop had moved but old stop had no indication of this, only Megabus welcome posters. Kind passerby informed us stop had relocated.2. Bus on time, Cardiff to Leeds change in Birmingham, I had vast amounts of texts informing me that due to Commonwealth Games the Birmingham stop had relocated.3. Bus clean, air con efficient and seats comfy. Wi fi and chargers at each seat4. Return journey ran late, Leeds to Bristol and if our connecting bus had not been late too we would have been stranded in 33 degrees of heat.5. Met off bus by Megabus dispatcher who told us to ‘stand over there and wait for late bus’. We did and connection eventually arrived.6. However he said the same thing to a others who were connecting to Devon. A young family, a pensioner amongst them all came off the Leeds bus after the 3 hour journey, and waited on pavement. What was not made clear was that they were waiting next to their connecting bus ( not Megabus bus a bright yellow coach) The coach left, the stranded people were upset but the dispatcher just kept repeating they should have talked to the driver not just stood there! He aimed his comments at a young black lad, possibly 12-13 years old, making it it his fault! This large stranded group were told another bus would be along in an hour, I do hope it had plenty of spare seats. Dispatcher showed no sympathy with their plight, obviously not his problem.7. Our Cardiff connection was caught in traffic on M4 and was late into Cardiff. However driver announced to us he had gone over his legal driving time so would not stop at University but drive straight in. When we arrived there was a large queue waiting to board, I do hope Megabus sorted this lack of legal driver quickly as by then it was 34 degreesAfter receiving a reply from Megabus I would like to add that they were correct in saying that their communications noted where the Cardiff stop was. However having used the Megabus previously we went to the old stop. There was a welcome to Megabus poster in the shelter and NO indication that the stop was no longer being used by a Megabus. Maybe this could be rectified by removing the poster and other Megabus signage",13 August 2022

"Unreliable service - do not pre-book your ticket, pay on boardTop Tip: Do not pre-buy your Megabus ticket, simply pay when boarding the coach. When the bus is late or does not show you have flexibility to choose another coach operator (e.g. National Express) without paying for 2 tickets!You need to be delayed at the bus depot for a min of 2-hours before any compensation will be considered by Megabus. Who in their right mind is going to stay at a bus depot for that long when they have a flight to catch??! But Megabus know this, so they never pay out.My experience.....Sunday 31st July I booked a MegaBus ticket for the 18.25 bus from London Heathrow 1,2,3 to Gatwick. The was 40mins late arriving with no apology or explanation from the driver who was rude when asked what caused the lateness. MegaBus are a ticket vendor, other companies provide the coaches .As an airport to airport service, the company & driver need to remember that passengers are on a tight time line to catch flights. After contacting MegaBus, they confirm to allow a minimum wait time of 90-120mins for any coach service they sell tickets for. (That is not a typo ... that is what their head office told me.)If there is a disaster with their service, they have no set plan to keep passengers moving but claim they ""will be dynamic in this instance"". Let's all hope our airline will also be dynamic & wait for passengers stranded at the bus depot by Megabus!",08 August 2022

Journey from HellUsed the Megabus last Monday from Birmingham to Glasgow...was 2 hours late due to a burst tyre en Route from London at Oxford.The coach arrived with no working toilet as a result several unscheduled comfort breaks were made.Due to all the extra time added on to the journey when we arrived at Preston the original crew had used their travel time allowance...a replacement crew had to be used...they took an hour to arrive...we eventually arrived 4 and a half hours late in Glasgow totally ruining the evening we had planned with some friends.We had a return journey booked today but couldn't face it so went by train instead which was without issue and on time..guess you get what you pay for... personally I won't ever use a Megabus again... would rather pay the extra and go by train....good luck if you decide to book with them...,06 August 2022

"Shame about the smellI have used the mega bus service lots of times in the last 12 months from Preston to London Victoria and return.Always polite staff and always on time.I usually sit upstairs and enjoy the views but this time I made a mistake and booked my seat downstairs unfortunately by the toilet.Wow does that stink and the nearby seats all had masks on (not for covid I can assure you).Surely when the bus stops at picking up points it can be cleaned quickly.Anyway this will not stop me using again, I will sit upstairs away from the smell.",03 August 2022
Fantastic customer serviceFantastic customer serviceUnfortunately my sister was unable to travel via mega bus as she was taken into hospital. I emailed them to explain and received a very timely response with a credit voucher for the full amount. This was not what I was expecting. This will enable her to travel at a later date. Thank you mega bus,02 August 2022
"Avoid Unless You Like Being RobbedAvoid Unless you like being robbed.I made a online booking for Megabus on 27th July for pick up at Gatwick Airport at 7:20pm. I paid 17.50 online.I waited for 1.5hrs and the bus never arrived at it’s scheduled times. I booked this service due to the rail strikes in London at the time and had no other affordable options. I ended up having to book another service, at additional cost, which luckily took me to my destination, LHR. I contacted their support and although responsive they said I was at the wrong stop, even though all signage at the Airport stated otherwise. They also mentioned that my confirmation stated that the service was being ran by Oxford rail and the alternate stop was on my confirmation?? I could not see the alternate stop notification anywhere on my confirmation. Avoid them at all cost. I feel robbed and used by this horrible service.",02 August 2022
"Pleasantly Surprised!Yesterday, as a result of rail workers striking (for what feels like the tenth time this month) to deliberately inconvenience the public and make travel almost impossible, I decided to give Megabus a try on their service M10 from London to Bristol and back.I'll be honest, I was absolutely terrified beforehand having read some of the horror stories described in the other reviews - but I ended the day pleasantly surprised!Both services left bang on time, and on the outbound journey we even arrived into Bristol a good 30 minutes early!The drivers were both friendly and helpful enough, and although the buses weren't anything to write home about (no tables, no curtains, no charging points), they were clean and suitable enough for a three hour journey.For the price (£8 return), I really can't complain - oh, and not to mention the Hard Rock Café discount you receive when you book online! 😉",31 July 2022
"Not reliable, not punctual, but get you from A to B in one pieceUsed Megabus services across the UK on several different occasions. Currently using a service to London from Aberdeen.Megabus is rarely on time, and due to their horrendous refund policy, not the best customer service.However if you need cheap travel and can afford up to 2 hour delays, and with the right planning, Megabus should be able to supply you with an almost pleasant experience.Flexibility in your personal schedule is needed for this service. So don't rely on them to be on time.",31 July 2022
"Luggage misplaced by MegaBus driver and company not positively respondingI travelled on a megabus on the 24th July 2022 departing at 9:35 AM from Manchester Airport, On my way to Newcastle Upon Tyne, the megabus broke down and it was parked in weatherby services on A1. It was replaced by another coach in weatherby services. Megabus driver asked passengers to get into the replaced bus and he will move all the luggage from broken down bus. When I got off the bus in Newcastle-upon-tyne, my luggage suitcase was missing. I already submitted a complaint on MissingX ref: 073a7421-5a92-4ddd-bf7c-8e30a79d9af8 but no response. MegaBus should look into matters like these seriously. Not sure what they do with the misplaced luggage. Their enquiry number gets disconnected even in their working hours. Megabus does not care about their customers, worse service ever.",30 July 2022

"Just never use themJust never use them. Every element of the service is absolutely appalling. Incredibly unprofessional staff, scammy terms of service, and rarely if ever on time. Waited over 2 and a half hours for a bus, having departed 25 minutes late in my first and therefore missing my connection. Entirely due to megabus’ poor performance. No compensation for the travel or subsequent plans missed, no refund, no sympathy for the inconvenience caused. Staff had little to no idea of schedules or even where the stops were, implying the problems exists from top to bottom in the company. Avoid at all costs.",27 July 2022
I waited 45 minutes for a bus from…I waited 45 minutes for a bus from Oxford to Bristol on the 12th July only for it not to show up and ended up having to buy a ticket for a train. I wrote an email expecting them to offer a refund but got the same reply that many users on here got that there is a non-refundable policy for up to 120 minutes delay (the bus apparently got there 70 minutes after it should have.) Very taken aback and upset by their response as there was no update or anything on the live tracker to show this. Feel scammed.,27 July 2022
"Horrible serviceHorrible service, customer service just doesn't care. My family and I, were in  Bournemouth at the bus stop at 5.15 pm. July 17th. According to the ticket departure time was at 5.30. We were going to Heathrow  Airport. However the bus just did not come.I do not know the reason.  All passengers have been waiting for 4 hours.  We contacted the megabus customer service  several times, the staff simply told us that they are booking the taxis  for all passengers but in reality, they did nothing  but constantly apologize.  Every single time we called - we received the same information on repeat. On one occasion we asked if they were booking taxis from Scotland, which is why we have been waiting for such a long time.  And yet they still did nothing but apologise. That is really nice  - customer service is  really polite,  and they have one star for that.After 4 hours a bus arrived from London.  Driver told us he is just  a driver   he has no instructions,  and he can not contact the office,  because it is too  late. If he got the instructions, he could  go back to London,  but  he did not get them, unfortunately.We were forced to go back to the hotel, because  all other busses were full,  no tickets. We  booked National express tickets for next morning.  We were  upset about that incident, our plans  were  ruined. I have never had such a terrible  experience.",27 July 2022
"Mega Bus are Mega Disgrace to the UK Transport SystemMega Bus is Mega Disgrace to the UK transport service. By far, the worst transport service provider in the UK. Their information dissemination strategy and CS is appalling. Our journey route was miscommunicated leaving several passengers stranded at Birmingham Great Charles street Queensway GC3 on the 21st July 2022. We had to make alternative journey arrangements which cost me over £155. Mega Bus refuse to make any refund. Don't use their service if you have a strict travel itinerary, 'cos you might regret it for a long time.",26 July 2022
"Atrocious, shocking, they simply don’t care.It’s a shame I can’t give them a 0.Their customer service is atrocious, shocking, they simply don’t care.Good evening,On Monday 04th July 2022, myself and two other passengers were waiting by the St. Ninians Roundabout bus stop, ready to board on the 07.09 am bus to Glasgow Bus Station.We saw the bus arrive around 07.10. One of the other passengers signalled the driver as we were all walking towards him to get ready to board the bus. The driver looked at us for a second, slowed down and then drive away, leaving us stranded. We had to wait 50 minutes for the next bus!We were all stunned and bewildered. This was 07.10 in the morning!!! - WE ARE GOING TO GLASGOW TO WORK!!. I had an interview that day at 9.00am - Which I missed for being late 20 minutes.The other two people were regular travellers also having to make excuses for being late for work.I have never experienced anything like this before - The bus driver had no intention to stop - HE SIMPLY DIDN’T FEEL LIKE IT.I have tried to contact MEGABUS to get an explanation for this driver outrageous behaviour, however:- They have completely ignored the fact that I missed my interview because of this and 2 other passengers were late because of this.- It took them 7 days to even acknowledge my email, and only because I chase them.- I had very unsatisfactory responses from Jodie, Laura and the worst one from someone named Eilidh - all three of them have completely ignored my situation.This seems to be something that drivers can get away with. They provide a service to people that also work - They have no understanding of the consequences for their passengers. THEY SIMPLY DON’T CAREIT’S A BIG OLD “0” FOR ME.",25 July 2022
"I waited from 5:30am for my 6:05 bus…I waited from 5:30am for my 6:05 bus until 7:20 by myself. There was no contact number, no text message for an update, online tracking showed no delay. I had no idea if my bus was going to show so I had to make a decision on how to get home from an area I was not familiar with. I forked out for a train on my credit card because I couldn't afford it but needed to get home. I contacted megabus who told me it's tough luck and I should have waited 120 minutes for it to arrive. If I was sent an alert that the bus was delayed and would be there in 120 minutes I would have made the decision to wait because I couldn't afford a train. Apparently that's irrelevant and they don't care.Megabus, don't reply telling me to contact you. I've done that and you've told me you don't care. Unless you are going to help me out with my credit card debt that I now have, just keep your ""contact us"" nonsense to yourself.",25 July 2022
"I would rate 0 if I could, DO NOT USEI would rate 0 if I could. I am not someone to write reviews at all but I am soooo appalled by Megabus. After purchasing a return ticket to Manchester I arrive at the stop 10 minutes before departure and the coach was not there. I have been liaisng with the customer service team which seem to have a braincell between them if that and they proceeded to tell me that it was booked via a private service with another coach, who wasn't mentioned on my booking at all. So obviously I wouldn't have known the correct coach to approach at all. They're now refusing to refund me including the return ticket which I said I would not be using because of how confusing the service is. I have had to spend an extra £62 on the train. Don't waste your time and money here, they're a dishonest theiving company.",24 July 2022

"Too much inconvenienceMega bus is good because is cheap but lately is been bad.If you want to go to a place, you have to change lots of buses and because they always late when you lose on, you lose all of them. Then you have to wait 2/3 hours for the next one. The inconvenience is just too much and even though is cheap makes it not worth.They should reduce the amount of buses change..Also theses new bases don’t have usb charges as we used to, neither free internet.",20 July 2022

"Sadly the poor reviews are true and Megabus are WORSE!The absolute worst end to our dream holiday! Megabus, you and yellow coaches should be utterly ashamed of yourselves.On Saturday 16th July 2022 our bus, the M3 from Bournemouth to London was CANCELLED after waiting for an HOUR with no information. I sent numerous tweets to Megabus who assured me that ""due to operational reasons"" the bus was delayed but was definitely not cancelled. After waiting for two hours, a small mini bus in ""yellow coaches"" livery turned up with a driver who hardly spoke English and had been in the UK from Romania for 2 days. He said he had no idea what was going on, and was just told to come to the stop to drop some passengers off. Anyway to cut a long story short, Megabus and yellow coaches were blaming the other for the complete and utter catastrophe.In the end they dispatched a load of taxis after 4 hours to convey everyone to Victoria. POOR COMMUNICATIONComplete disregard for children and the elderly who were standing around in the sun, no food or water vouchers.Whilst this ordeal was going on, national express coach after national express coach was going passed.I used to read these awful reviews of Megabus and Scoff and think; surely they can't be that bad, Megabus is in fact worse! Save your money and use national express instead, or the train!Shame on you Megabus and yellow coaches!!!.",18 July 2022

"Cancelled service - refused refundI arrived 25 minutes early to departing stop, for travel from London to Heathrow. After 10/15 mins, I was informed by a Megabus employee at the stop that the service had been cancelled, that the next service was going to be an hour after that one was due to depart, and that they couldn’t tell me whether I was going to be able to get a seat on it. Obviously, as I was travelling to the airport for an international flight I couldn’t risk a) waiting  a whole hour and b) not getting a seat on that bus, which would result in me missing my flight.Luckily, I was able to make alternate arrangements with a different company that had a service departing in 20 minutes, so opted to travel with them instead, given the above stated risks.I’ve been refused a refund by Megabus for the cancelled service, on the grounds that there was a later bus (again, that I was told I wouldn’t be guaranteed a seat on), because their policy is that they won’t refund for delays of up to 120-minutes. They need to seriously rethink this for routes that service airports, they can’t expect people to take that kind of risk.",16 July 2022

"They Don't Care!On Friday 8th July 2022 my Wife and I returned to the UK from the US after visiting friends, on arrival at Heathrow we booked our transport home, via mobile phone, received email confirmation of Reservation Number 49/50-2783-080722-CM3-1215-LHR-LEI-/ and we made our way to the departure gate.​However, upon arriving at the departure area I noted my mobile phone battery had run out therefore I had no means with which to open my email and show our tickets to the driver. So, we approached a Megabus (not our bus) and asked the driver for help, his attitude was terrible, all he would say repeatedly was ""no tickets, no bus"".This driver who hadn't an ounce of Customer Service didn't attempt to help, he made no contact with Stage Coach to confirm our booking, didn't give us any options,  a phone number, anything, just kept saying ""no tickets, no bus"", then he watched us frantically going through our luggage in the street trying to find a phone charger.Unfortunately, all to no avail, our bus left at the advertised time without two passengers that had legitimate tickets, my Wife and I.I should add we are in our mid 60's, we are not masters of all things IT, and we certainly don't do ""bunking"" on buses to get home from holidays.So Megabus has no processes or procedures in place to help legitimate ticket holders that cannot through no fault of their own, for whatever miniscule reason, access their email to confirm they have tickets, even if they are pensioners?They refuse to escalate this as they say it is a terms and conditions matter, and as these were the terms and conditions we agreed to upon purchasing our ticket this cannot be escalated as a complaint.Given this episode is clearly one of customers in their mid-sixties being treated with utter contempt by firstly Megabus's driver, left by the roadside WITH tickets, but then by Customer Service too, we have no option but to complain to the regulator.It's not about the refund, it never has been, the company has a ""don't give a toss"" attitude towards most of your Customers.",14 July 2022

It was late evening, she was rejected to board by the bus driver, only becuase she had 2 checkin luggage. If british ariways allows 2 checkin bags, why operate a bus from airport that cannot take 2 bags? worst experience just when an she arrive to UK, not the best welcome experience. she lost her ticket, as it would not let her amend for extra luggage for the next bus 1.5 hours later. So had to buy a new national express ticket .. never travel with mega bus .. you get what you pay for!Now got reply from mega bus that 2 bags upto 20Kgs allowed, then why was my sister-in-law denied boarding by the driver ?

"Absolutely never again!Absolutely never again!Booked a return ticket from London Victoria to Bournemouth.The journey going there was acceptable apart from being over 1 hour over late of the stated time, driver took a detour through the New Forest, so missed part of the event I was attending.On the way back it was absolutely appalling. I have never felt so scared at being in the hands of another driver.He stopped at the second stop which was the Bournemouth coach station, while I and two other passengers where aboard he kept the coach locked while the driver went to the toilet a (number 2) no problem with that but he left the door open after so we could all smell his odour.The driver let all the other passengers on, he did not deliver a safety announcement, he did not tell passengers to where their seatbelts (some need telling unfortunately).The roof windows where closed at the back and only part of the window was open at the front, AC felt like it was blowing hot air, all on the hottest day of the year.If that wasn't bad enough, the driver was tail gating other drivers on the motorway at 70mph.He was getting super close to the cars in front to bully them out of the way, flashing his lights and swearing.He did this on 5/6 occasions, when we finally got into central London, he blocked a junction so the traffic could not flow then slammed on his breaks as he almost hit the car it front of us.Absolutely appalling first time using mega bus as your competitors where fully booked, and that is the last time.I have never felt so scared and worried that I would be in a major accident at the hands of your driver.Appalling.",13 July 2022

"I will not rely on megabus anymoreI will not rely on megabus anymore. I booked 6.10 am busy from Bristol UWE to Heathrow today and the bus did not show up. No notifications about late arrivals were communicated as well. Had a choice of getting a taxi or waiting for a bus which may or may not show up. We did not want to take the risk of missing our flight and lose the pricey tickets. We ended up getting taxi. When approached the customer service we were told that the bus turned up 70min later which was within the time frame of their policy which meant they will not e even reimburse for the journey! It is an absolute joke to be expecting people to still have hopes of the bus turning up this late without any communication what so ever in this world of technology when they could have sent a text message about the delay or place the delay message on their tracker system!

DO NOT USE MEGABUSService did not arrive. Booked from Derby to meet a connection in London for London Heathrow flight. On phoning their customer service I was told to find alternative transport as the service would be 90 mins late (with no guarantee of that or that it would be further delayed into the journey)  and for which I would be reimbursed. I then had the inconvenience and extra cost of taxis and train to meet my connections. On subsequently asking for reimbursement and supplying receipts I was informed that they do not compensate under 120mins. If a passenger is not there to meet a delayed service how do they know that a service is not more than 90 mins late?,09 July 2022

Rude and money grabbing companyDo not recommend this service. Very bad customer service and late service. The bus service didn’t even stop at the bus stop while seeing people are standing and waiting for the booked bus. The emergency numbers are not even working. I have complained through their E-mail and they will send a manipulated pre planned reply to each passenger. Customer service centre is thinking people are travelling for free. No refund from the mistake from the bus service and driver’s also rude and unhelpful. Tracking system is with full of misleading things and no proper alerts are giving when some construction or route related delay happened. Always providing late arrival and departure.

"Ableist new disability policyThey just changed their disability policy without mentioning it anywhere.Also they have now stopped Megabus plus which was brilliant.With my disability, I cannot be on a coach for 6-8 hours like it takes without megabusplus, so can't use the service anymore even though I have used it religiously for over a decade, if not 2 decades!!They made it now so if you are disabled and travel with them, unless you have a wheelchair with you, they won't let you get priority access (ie telling them you need help in advance)All you can do is ask the driver!Which is stupid as we are disabled. We now have to either wait to board and risk no seats or queue and risk a trip to A&E!!I can't stand for long so I can't queue but they now refuse to help at all.All we want is for them to tell the driver in advance a disabled person is getting on here so save a space as they can't walk far.They will NOT do that anymore unless you have a wheelchair!So even though I am a ambulatory wheelchair user, as I won't have it with me I couldn't get a seat booked in advance...As a side note, to make it worse they did this mid way through an email conversation where I asked for seats a month prior and was told it was booked. They didn't so I asked to book one. I was offered one again and replied. As they take ages to rerply, I asked on Twitter to speed it up.A few days later, they replied saying I can't have a seat anymore. Even though offered one already because they changed policy...Just because I can't speak on the phone easy doesn't make it ok to change a decisions already made whilst email replying all because your team takes days to a week to reply! I asked for the seat and was offered it twice and replied before any change!They said I should be able to sit downstairs this once after about 100 more messages but this still doesn't change the fact a policy was changed making it harder for disabled people to get accessibility!The equality act is still a thing too.""Ask the driver"" is NOT accessibility!!!!We are still disabled!Change the policy back and let disabled people book priority access just like before.If you need proof I am sure they will have either  blue badge, pip or esa letter.There is no excuse for removing people not in a wheelchair from the disability access policy!We are still disabled just the same!Some of us even have a wheelchair but we are ambulatory users so don't always have it if someone else is helping etc.They just say ask the driver now but we all know how the drivers don't help even when they are supposed to as I found out on my last journey where I had booked accessibility in advance (a few years back) and he refused and wouldn't help.There were seats downstairs but he wouldn't let anyone sit there even though I had already been told I could.Him and the passengers all watched and listened me begging for help and neither him nor anyone moved seats for me. Instead I had to walk up the stairs at the front all the way to the back!I was nauseous the whole time and in massive pain. I went to A&E the next day because of this.My experiences haven't been great but the change of disability policy is disgraceful!",04 July 2022

The Airconditioning in the bus was not working, resulting in the interior of the bus being well over 30 degrees. Worse than this, there was zero ventilation and the driver just responded that it was broken and that he was a driver and not a mechanic, so could not do anything.

"Delayed service to and from SilverstoneJuly 2, AM 2022. 14 people waiting for a bus at 08.30 to take us from Warwick to Silverstone. No bus arrived. Megabus resolved it by sending taxis that arrrived 20 minutes later than the scheduled pick up time. Taxi dropped us off 1 mile from main entrance at Silverstone. We were told there would be no problem for the return trip at 4.30pm. We arrived on time for the bus at 4.30pm. We were told the bus would not arrive. Instead, we were put on another bus that first took us to Bedford then onto Warwick. This added 1 hour 15 minutes to our return journey. Credit to the Megabus team for resolving 2 bus issues that should not have happened in the first place.",02 July 2022
Bus showed up 40minutes late then said…Bus showed up 40minutes late then said the driver can't drive til 1am. Absolute joke of a company. Forget using them I won't again,02 July 2022
This is the second time I have used…This is the second time I have used megabus. 1st time I was left stranded on Finchley Road London on a Friday night after the bus didnt stop. This time it just didn't show uo at all. I stopped a bus. The driver said its running late. 3 hrs later stuck in London again. What a complete shower . Coach tracker dont work.  No customer service after 5pm. . All they can say is refund. What about the £80 it cost to get home. Avoid at all costs. Flex bus always turns up and sends updates if late. This company should have thier licence revoked.,01 July 2022
"Trash serviceTrash service. They sold me tickets at an upcharge for seats in the front and then refused to provide those seats. The bus driver said there were no reservations even though they sold me reserved seats. I was forced to carry on in my journey in cramped seating. I reached out to them to resolve the issue but they refused to help. I reached out on multiple platforms and they continued to refuse to help me or refund the tickets for the journey (it was a difficult one, I had picked those seats due to a leg injury). I was forced to finally dispute the charge through my bank who ruled in my favour. I will never ride with this service again, and I warn anyone else to do so as well.",28 June 2022
"Avoid like the plagueIf you would like to arrive at your destination two hours later than expected, be offered no explanation for why you’ve been delayed so dramatically, and be subjected to some of the most atrocious smells known to man, then choose megabus.",27 June 2022
Awful experienceAwful experience. The bus arrived 25 minutes late without any explanation. The driver threatened to throw people off the bus for asking the reason for the delay. Several people were denied entry although they had tickets due to mishandling of bus capacity. Avoid at all costs if you wish to catch your flight.,26 June 2022
"Suffocating in toilet smell!I am giving 2* because service is on time and drivers are polite and nice.Other than that, did not realise a budget trip including extra payment for a front seat meant suffocating with a toilet smell the entire 3h journey. Guess seats 1 and 2 are above the downstairs toilet and by end of the day, the smell is faint-inducing. By dad went to the toilet itself and said he almost suffocated from disgust and smell. I get it is cheap, but it shouldn't be at the cost of not being able to breathe.",26 June 2022

"Better than expected.First time using megabus and i was pleasantly surprised. I was picked up on time on both trips, coming back we were delayed for the connection but our connection waited, which no one expected. My only complaint is that the driver of the delayed bus did not communicate with us about our detour, he dropped us off outside the bus station as the other bus was in the stand waiting. Otherwise a good trip. Only gave them a go because of the rail strikes but I would use them again.",26 June 2022

"No fuss MegabusI travelled with my daughter from Leeds to Sunderland to see Elton John in concert. Looked trains but way too long a journey. Thought I’d try the Megabus as an alternative. It was a great service. On time, just 1 stop off on the way. We booked extra legroom and the seats were comfortable for a 2 hour journey. I have no complaints. Didn’t use the toilet though but didn’t need it so can’t make a comment on the cleanliness. £50 return for both of us. Even managed to get some sleep on the way back.",25 June 2022

Waiting over an hour and half for both of the trips I took with them no refund policy. The left hand side of the bus has no power to the charging outlets, Pure chancers, sticking with trains or national express in future and to top it off the staff I encountered was miserable, I reckon working for a rubbish company like this has taken a toll. They don’t deserve 1 star. The toilets Are unusable for women and you can’t wash your hands.",24 June 2022
Newcastle to Dunbar good tripBooked from Newcastle to Dunbar the night before travelling. Good price. Expected it to be busy on day of train strike but it was only half full.

"DO NOT TRAVEL WITH MEGABUSI am giving it 1 star because it won't let me give 0! But we have had TWO awefull experiences with this company. Yesterday we took a bus from Manchester to London and it got delayed for 45 minutes, while waiting, the ""coach tracker"" said the bus was on time THE WHOLE TIME, and they never notified us or apologized. The bus had no working chargers, ac or enough space between seats, it was just terrible. TODAY we had to go to the airport and it is LATE AGAIN, we had to pay for another bus because we don't want to miss the flight, it was a waste of money and time. We tried to contact but NO answer from them. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE EVER, YOU WILL REGRET IT, IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!",18 June 2022

"Normally good but today…From Manchester to London, Okay lemme just get this straight absolutely good value for money no doubt about it 👌, buses are pretty much on schedule most times and the few times it is not is only 10-15 mins off schedule which is bearable. However today was the absolute worst bus service ever from you guys EVER. The usual 2 buses didn’t come ,which was fine. However this ‘new’ bus we entered on was extremely uncomfortable, it’s like you’re trying to squash as much passengers on a bus as possible. I barely had any space to move my legs. No retractor on the seat ,making sleeping impossible in already tight areas, AC didn’t work so i was boiling. The removal of wall chargers made life hell, no place to charge my laptop/phone while getting work done😡. If i expected such a terrible bus I would’ve bought a power bank. Wireless charging place is pathetic. No point using it. What happened to the buses with 3 seats? Way more comfortable. Normally the service is good, but today’s bus was just abysmal.",08 June 2022
"Worst bus trip in UK by farAbsolutely awful, will never use again. Had a trip from Edinburgh to London (22:40 on 5th June) and everything was just bad. Minor delay we can accept but the bus was colder inside than outside and the attitude of the staff was appalling.We asked the driver to lower down or turn off the AC which he did for about an hour before he turned it on again. That lead to almost no sleep due to being cold and it wasn't just us - most people had jackets on for the entire ride and some even wore hats.Also, staff was just plain rude with the driver loudly complaining to his colleague in Newcastle that someone was too cold and he had to turn the AC off. Which then lead to the other man coming upstairs to loudly note that he has never heard of such thing (at 1:30am with people sleeping). Overall, extremely loud and unpolite, inconsiderate of customers needs.No one expects a 5 star service but could we at least get the basics?",06 June 2022

Despicable customer service, I understand the roads are not always reliable, but is it fair to charge people for a service that is so ridiculously unreliable?You should be giving refunds to every customer for being late, you shouldn’t be taking money of people for a service you fail to provide properly in these difficult times because YOU can’t stick to a schedule. If it was only a ten minute delay and you answered the phones, it wouldn’t be an issue. But you can’t expect people to pay and wait hours for the bus to show up.People, you are always best of getting trains.",01 June 2022

"Don’t trust the bad reviews, this is a great service.I felt compelled to write this because before my trip I had read all of these terrible reviews and it would probably put a lot of people off.I have never been more surprised at how good a service can be that is also value for money. You will notice in most bad reviews, the staff are being called unprofessional. They are not being unprofessional, they are doing their job while the public are either late, miss their train, or don’t get back on the bus in time. I saw all customers seem happy on their travels today, including myself. Friendly staff, on time, good communication and a nice clean bus. What more do you want for these prices?! The Wi-Fi isn’t great, but it’s not great on trains that are double the price either.Chargers worked fine, and the public toilet smells like a public toilet…. If you do what you are meant to do as a customer, I don’t see why you would have any issues using the mega bus. So impressed and I will definitely be using again.

One weirdly asked me and my friends if we liked his bus as we were walking past. From Bristol to Cardiff, our bus left 10 minutes early and we had to chase him and luckily he stopped. From Cardiff back to Bristol, we told the driver we were going to Bristol and he said okay and drove off without us despite him knowing we were going to Bristol. We ended up taking the train back to Bristol instead.They’ve also asked me for details for a further inquiry to make themselves look good. Nothing has been done.",16 May 2022
Pathetic behaviour of bus driver3 of us have been travelling from Barnstaple to Bristol (14th May 8:50) and the driver at first seemed very nice. We have reached Taunton and as usual went to the shop to use the toilet. It took us 3min when the driver came screaming at us that we are late. We kindly asked to wait and we were only using toilet as the WC on a bus was trashed. He was shouting back that it’s not his problem. Okay. Then Just before Weston bus stop he announced on a speaker that because of us he won’t stop at the next bus station. I’m extremely shocked at what kind of customer service we’ve received. I have been using MegaBus for years and never ever had an issue. Absolutely pathetic. Never use again.,14 May 2022
"The worst company to travel withThe worst company to travel with.I had to travel for work, and due to my boss being really mean, it got cancelled randomly. I contacted them and tried to get it exchanged, and the customer service I  received was appalling.Unfortunately, the company didn’t have any form of compassion or understanding at all.Speaking to them will simply isn’t worth it. Not only was it so hard to find the contact details the customer service was the worse thing ever.The company also listens to lies Police officers tell them and uses it as a form of bullying.Also, the toilets are never clean and hardly have any soap or clean water that doesn’t smell weird. Using the company's toilets left you with rashes and a strange smell afterwards (very unclean). If you don’t want to have any form of weird smell/ rashes, I wouldn't recommend travelling with them.Spend extra elsewhere with better customer service than with them. I would not recommend them AT ALL, mostly the customer service. I would give them a 0/5, but it wouldn't let me, so, unfortunately, I had to give 1/5.",14 May 2022

Appalling communication and after service.***EDIT***In response to your reply, the issue wasn't really the delay, it was the lack of commication.  If I had known it was going to set off 43 mins late that was no problem, but because you left me sat there, after 30 mins i had to make alternative arrangements.In effect what you are saying is that you could have left me sat there without communication for 119 mins and still not offered me my £14 back.

"Would you like to take a risk of miss your flight???Just to warn you guys, if Megabus doesn't appear on the stop that you purchase the ticket from, make sure you record this, also make sure you get the contact details of the other passengers. Recently I purchased a ticket from Megabus and was supposed to take the bus from University Stop across Subway in Cardiff, went there half an hour before, stood there over an hour with other passengers. Megabus didn't appear!! I had to rush to the train station as I missed the National Express while waiting for Megabus. I had to take UBER again to the train station, cost me over £100 to reach Heathrow Airport to catch my international flight. You should either be very careful by taking a risk of Megabus may not appear at your stop or be very cautious. My suggestion is to take recordings and also if possible get camera recordings of surrounding shops etc as Megabus will deny that their busses absence on this stop. It happened to me, even though I provided the tickets etc. Megabus shamelessly came back and said their bus trackers say that the bus had been to that stop.

The driver made us wear face masks although all restrictions have been lifted. He even pulled over to tell a few people off for not having the mask on.

Then the ""live tracker"" updated and said I'd missed the coach. Tweeted to megabus, they said the tracker had malfunctioned. I then missed out on a night in London, and had to pay fuel costs to get myself there. After 7 emails, megabus refunded my travel, but won't cover the costs of my missed hotel room and fuel costs, as they should under the Consumer Rights Act.

"I've just tried to change a ticket…UPDATE: Following a conversation with head office, I have now received a full refund, not just for my second purchase, but for the original tickets. On that basis I have improved my rating.I still won't use them (the system is beyond me), but appreciate they have listened and helped me at a really difficult time. For that I am very grateful.UPDATE: I've not changed the tickets, I've bought more. The system is so complicated for me (I'm ASD/ADHD) I've bought the tickets twice and obviously no refund. So not only am I not going to be able to travel, I'm £100 down. that second £50 was my food/expenses money so I'll be hungry as well as not being there for family at this time. WOULD NOT USE even for free.I've just tried to change a ticket and it's not that they won't let me, it's that the system is unnecessarily difficult it's had me in tears.What should happen is you go to your account and click tickets you need to change; in my case outbound and return. This gives you an electronic voucher or amount in your account. Doesn't have to be a refund, a virtual one would do. Then you can either rebook straight away or when you're ready. Vouchers could be valid for a month, or 6 months - doesn't matter.What actually happens is you can't log on. You try to use the bot chat thing but it keeps giving you lots of links you've already tried then cuts you off.Forth attempt you get a person who 'helps' by copy and pasting the same information into the chat box from the bot but less personality. When you say AGAIN you can't even get through log in they change your email address without asking (I assumed he was checking it, not changing).I finally log in and have to manually type in the UNBELIVEABLY long code for the first ticket and my changed email address. Then that goes into a basket.Then I go back to my original ticket and find the next RIDICULOUSLY long code and slowly, carefully type that into the box (ticket was text to phone, I'm on laptop so couldn't copy and paste and absolutely couldn't do this on my tiny phone screen).Finally the second amount now pops into basket but hang on...What's THIS? There is a timer ticking away and I'm now logged out and have to start the whole thing again.3 attempts it took to change the ticket, and by the time you get to the new tickets in basket stage the running total is gone so you're constantly having to add up and compare to original ticket costs as they will not let you keep the difference whilst watching the dreaded countdown of doom. One purchase one chance.Now I travel a lot although this would have been my first time on megabus. I honestly can't comment on the staff, or the cleanliness of the vehicles but I'm sure others have, I can only state 100%, their system and support service is worse than any train system I've ever used here or abroad. Worse than the other national bus service I sometimes use.Honestly won't use the tickets I've bought as they are just horrible, I'll 'gift' the value to someone and rebook for them. I'd let them runout but I can't stand the idea that they profit from me without a product or even attempt at offering a service.",20 April 2022

"Theft of Cabin Bag/Suitcase on bus Megabus no helpThe bus driver handed over our cabin bag /suitcase to a person whom it didn’t belong to, and they won’t take responsibility for it. I am very disappointed and we have been left feeling pretty violated from this incident. It is unacceptable.  This was no accident as there was no similar luggage so this was a deliberate act.Megabus only reply with send us the query via email.  We go around in circles with no feedback.  How can Megabus say they do not take responsibility for your luggage if they make stops along the way and you are not able to see from inside the bus what is happening with your luggage.  They do not even have a proper way of identifying who luggage belongs to whom. All the bus driver could say was sorry.  It had my personal belongings.  I would rather pay extra and take the train or another service.  Please avoid Megabus at all costs!",19 April 2022
"Thank youI went from Cornwall to London and back for a total of around £35 very friendly staff, they checked all passengers were aboard before departing each stop. Coach was on time, fantastic value for money, the only slight annoyance was the charger sockets not working but bring a power bank and you're all good. Not a bad word to say. Very happy and will be using again, thank you so much megabus for allowing me to see my family for an affordable price.",18 April 2022

"Reserved Seat scamI paid for a reserve seat on the big bus however the one that showed up was smaller, with no reserved seats, no charger ports and completely unclean and smelled horrible.

"Overbooked unorganized and unfriendly staffWe used Megabus this month from London to Warrington. On the way there the bus was an hour late and we got no information by any member of staff. Then they put us on a bus to hounslow for some reason and they said a bus would come shortly. No bus came for 30 minutes. Staff was really rude and didn’t answer any questions.However the worst part was the journey back. The bus was already 30 minutes late but that seems to be normal for this company (no email, message, anything) and wheat came from Manchester it was already full. There weren’t enough spaces for all the people that wanted to get on. The staff didn’t say anything about people lying sleeping on seats blocking them from other people. About 7 people including us were left behind as there was no space and we had to pay 100£ for trains to get home somehow.",16 April 2022
Worst coach service everI would advice people never to travel with megabus.   I got a coach from Manchester to Newcastle and it was a living nightmare.       There wasn’t enough seats for everyone on the coach because “they brought the wrong size coach”I have autism and found a seat but the driver then tried to get me off the bus and shouted at me when I had a sensory overload.   Drivers need Autism awareness trainingThen was 1hour late into Newcastle and I made a complaint which was pointlessMegabus you as a company a public transport service should be all ashamed of your selves and I’m NEVER travelling with yous ever againFlix bus is definitely much better and of course National Express is too,15 April 2022

"Terrible journeyI took the bus from Manchester to London.30Minutes delay at the start, and 1.5h delay in the end)At first the bus was much to warm and the air really old ( not really good in times of covid), like the ventilation was not turned on.I did go and told him that the ventilation is not turned on and he told me it‘s not possible to do anything and not in a very friendly manner.5 Minutes later the ventilation was working but it was set to really cold, and it just got freezing.We did stops on the road and the driver did not say anything through the speakers, why we had to stop.So just invest some more pounds and take the national express or another bus company.Terrible experience.",29 March 2022
"Absolutely Disgusting ServiceI travel a lot between Leeds-Bristol and Leeds-Newcastle and always used Megabus. Seven years ago when I started travelling with them they looked after their customers, I could never fault the service apart from on one occasion which they resolved promptly. Now it seems as though once they have your money you no longer exist to them.Always running late, the drivers talk down to the customers, shout at people, throw your luggage about without a care what might be inside. The toilets stink the coach out, the floors are always filthy, the seats ain't much better and you can never see out the windows. Air-con seems to be on when it's cold but doesn't work when it's hot. On one occasion when I asked the driver if he could turn the air-con down or off he told me he can't adjust it because one passenger isn't happy, and he said that in a nasty, spiteful way. On another occasion I arrived in Bristol 3 hours and 20 minutes late meaning I had a very long walk as the last bus had gone. I complained and got a snotty reply which included ""we do not offer refunds""It's shocking how bad this service has got and over such a small period of time as well.I will NEVER travel with Megabus again and I recommend no one else does either... National Express are as cheap if not a little cheaper sometimes, and the service they provide is actually very good which I hope doesn't change like it did with Megabus. I am sat on one of their coaches while writing this and I paid £13 for this 210 mile journey.There should be an option to give a company minus star ratings.",28 March 2022

As human we need to take rest after long time working hour.So, he took one hour rest.Then the bus started journey at 19:55. We lost our 2 hours of time by megabus cheating time. My question is the megabus authority u lost our time if i count roughly 40 to 50 people we are lost our  roughly 100hours. Will u  able to give my 2 hour?Without reason why i am lost my time for your faulty?So urge the authority please don’t loss someone valuable time for ur faulty.",24 March 2022

That's obviously a lie.Finally got through on a chat line where I was told it had not arrived due to another vehicle being on fire, so it was not coming at all.Meantime I had missed alternate services that would have got me there.As at 1 hour after approximate departure time still showing ""as scheduled"" on the coach tracker.Do not appreciate being lied to.",24 March 2022

"Don’t use Megabus (Stagecoach)To their credit, the two tickets were only £20 from Coventry to London but it was £20 wasted as it never came. Waited an hour past the due time (90 minutes in total) until 21:00. The coach never came. 100 miles from home, gave up and forked out for the train instead.No way to contact Megabus; unmanned bus station, 24 hour helpline closed at 6pm, as did their online chat. No out-of-hours help of any sort. Online tracker said the bus was running to schedule and the display board said no bus was due.If that wasn’t bad enough, later tried to get a refund but Megabus wouldn’t even let us make a complain, stating we should have waited until 22:00 (2 hours past the due time)…Will never use Megabus or Stagecoach again. Will always pay a little more and use National Express or take the train. Learnt my lesson. They say you get what you pay for, but Megabus won’t even give you that.",15 March 2022

Absolutely shocking experienceAbsolutely shocking experience. My suitcase was left on their coach on the 2/11/2021. I contacted them explaining that the previous bus driver has taken my suitcase to lost and found. Was told to wait as it can take a few days to be uploaded to the list and found page. A few weeks past and then my emails start to get ignored. I even made a complaint and that was ignored!!! They keep telling me that someone will be in contact and nothing. The customer service is absolutely shocking. I know their game is that they want me to wait until after the 3 months so they are no longer liable. I have spoken to numerous drivers who have stated where the suitcase could be but I get no help form megabus. So either my suitcase was misplaced or stolen by megabus as I have proof that the driver has taken it to the lost and found. DO NOT TRAVEL WITH MEGABUS.,29 December 2021

The first time I used this company last month, I was meant to be on a direct bus from Manchester to London, but they turfed everybody out at Birmingham because a driver didn’t turn up. They said another bus would be along in half an hour, which then turned to an hour, which then turned into three hours- no one informed us of the further delays after saying that it would be an hour late. We were just repeatedly told it was coming. They left all the passengers including women and children who were onboard out on Brunel street in Birmingham, not even an indoor bus stop, freezing cold, and crying. I thought this would be a one off. This morning, I arrived early for my bus – to watch it depart over 10 minutes early before I got to the stand. There is no customer service to ring, only social media and email – this is the very last time I will ever ever attempt to use this company – I have never experienced any travel company be so dreadful and cause so much stress and upset in all my life. They need to be shut down, they shouldn’t even have a licence to operate being as bad as they are. They don’t even deserve the one star, if there was an option for 0 that would more accurately reflect their service. Absolute disgrace. DO NOT USE!",16 December 2021

"Security risk unable to trace lost luggageI left my bag in the hold of bus when I got off at Leeds. My fault admittedly.  I filled in lost luggage form from their website and  two weeks later I'm still waiting. It is worrying from a security point of view that the company seems unable to trace left  luggage. It is also probably a matter for the police as there is a  legal responsibility for companies to deal properly with lost property. If I do not hear from them soon I will need to take legal advice. Highlights a chaotically run company and to make matters worse, there is no phone number to contact them on and no details of the whereabouts of their lost property offices.",10 December 2021
"absolute the worst!absolute the worst!! booked a bus for my cousin from gatwick to Heathrow. on the ticket said south terminal, only then to find out that terminal is closed. i ein panic i booked a national bus just incase the bus never showed. a whole hour running around trytrying to find where this bus could be as no one in the airport know. £27 + £17 later. the bus was on north terminal. they failed to admit the bus was never on the south and just blamed the third party and will not offer any compensation for buying a ticket from national due ti megabus' lack of communoh year. couldn't call anyome and their online teamus crazy run around with no answer.",09 December 2021
"Not sure why so many negative reviewsBooked my coach journey from Coventry to London at 2:40am. Out of curiosity checked the reviews and at that point I thought to myself what have I just done because chances are my coach would not arrive and leave me stranded in the middle of the night or they would arrive early and leave, based on the reviews. Due to this I wanted to make sure I leave on time so have no trouble, however when your drinking and partying you don't have a sense of time and I realised too late. Megabus clearly state that I should arrive at least 15 minutes before departure. I was very worried I was going to miss this coach and be stuck in a city i'm not familiar with because many people said they do not wait however to my surprise when my taxi arrived at the coach station at 02:37 the coach was still there. Journey on board is standard. I would definitely book megabus again",08 December 2021
"I'd rather be in the Cecil Hotel than MegabusI wish I could give zero stars. First of all, the bus came late. Then the driver went missing for like an hour???????On the way back, they suffocated us to death. Literally, the bus was overheating and about to explode. I am not even joking like oxygen on the bus is THE ONE SINGLE thing you cannot screw up, and somehow they did that. The AC sockets were throwing out hot air like it was confetti  to the point everyone was begging the bus driver to stop and let them out.DO NOT RECOMMEND!",06 December 2021

"Discriminating driverAbsolutely appalled at the driver from London to Bristol at 3pm on the 28/11/2021. My boyfriend is diabetic and was having a hypo before we were due to leave so we quickly grabbed a McDonalds so that he could eat something. We then headed to the Coach where we were approached by an extremely rude aggressive coach driver who told us we weren’t allowed hot food on the coach. I calmly explained that I understand however, my boyfriend has a medical condition, diabetes, and he was having a hypo and needed to eat to which the coach driver responded “I don’t care about his medical condition” he also told my boyfriend to stop broadcasting his medical condition to the world! Another worker said that whilst we wouldn’t be able to bring hot food onto the coach he would let us go to the shop and purchase some cold food however, the coach driver then told us we were not welcome on his coach and that we were banned. I find this actually disgusting as yes I do appreciate that you have rules, the truth is we just weren’t really thinking about that, the main priority was getting my boyfriends sugars up. I have also emailed your customer service team and am yet to receive a reply.Honestly, up until last weekend my experience with Megabus has been positive however, I really am appalled that you have someone so blatantly discriminatory and callous working for your company .",01 December 2021
"Watch for online bookings!Booked ticket online for Sunday 28th of Nov, due to trains being cancelled. All went well, I thought, but at the bus station the driver told me that my ticket is actually for Monday 29th!  Had to purchase another ticket on the spot.Other people in the queue asked me if I had to purchase 2nd ticket, as they all had the same issue - which looked like some website error, perhaps due to high demand (lots of people had to use buses instead of trains)?. I definitely set the website for 28th, but after payment was completed the pdf ticket showed 29th.Contacted Megabus to see if i could get the refund for wrong ticket - nope, all tickets are non-refundable, they won't accept any responsibility for website bookings either.For me, it was first, and the last trip with Megabus. I would only advise caution when you book the ticket, considering there were other people with the same issue at the bus station, I would hazard guessing this is re-occurring thing - so just be aware that you ""cheap"" ticket might cost you ... twice, or more.  My ticket booked initially was £22.1 (understandable, if website booked it for day ahead), and ticket on the spot £34.80. £56.90 overall.Also, as a side note, a journey that should be 3h according to their schedule took 3h50m - with very little traffic on the roads.

"Good coach driverLast night we were stuck in Edinburgh and there was pretty much a full bus, probably because the trains were all cancelled. We were going to Dundee and the driver went out of his way to get us on even though we hadn't booked. Really appreciated it as it was baltic outside and don't know what we would've done if we hadn't got on. Had never been on a megabus and was surprised at how nice it was.

We all had a meeting in London at 11 and it was very important for us to reach before that. It’s a shame to tell that we couldn’t attend our meeting just due to bus delay. It was so unprofessional. Many people book the tickets after checking the drop off time which is very important. It was very embarrassing to reschedule our client meeting for next day.

"Edinburgh to NewcastleGot the bus from Edinburgh to Newcastle on 26th October at 22:45 and one of the drivers was the rudest person I have ever came across. Asked to see tickets and a youngish girl 2 people infront shown him her ticket on her phone and he replied “next person with a ticket I can actually see” and dismissed her. Took the next person fine. Then came back to her and made a rude comment about the weight of her bag which looked absolutely fine. Next person up had 2 bags which fair enough isn’t allowed but instead of communicating this he said “so which bag are you taking??”. He did very ‘kindly’ accept it “this time” but gave him so much grief the poor fella probably would have rather left a bag behind, he was that horrible! Absolutely zero customer service skills will definitely never be using megabus again would rather pay more and be treated with some respect and manners.

Horrible experience I won't be forgetting in a hurry.Bus was late to the terminal for boarding and leaving bad enough. Standing in a queue for 1hr 30mins. No updates as no staff member at station. Passengers had to resort to detectives to find out what's happened and how delayed service was if it was still coming at all and wouldn't just leave all stranded.Boarded and moved off we have a bad puncture and tyre coming off the wheel so stranded for a further 4hrs before a replacement sent out arrived. So far bad, worse.Moved off now 4hrs plus into arrival time and 12hrs+journey, replacement driver pulls over and declares he's taking a 45min break and there's nothing we can do about it. No compassion or empathy to perhaps explain to us from the start what was going to happen or blame his company not sending 2 drivers considering the situation. Driver just disregarded our feelings and already fkd up night, shouted us down quoting his age and working/driving hours and said don't blame me.Who do I blame then? Myself for using this service ever again perhaps. Because if you're not aware as other reviews have shouted from rooftops very bad customer service this company and more times bad service too. Right this moment sat 15hrs into journey at a layby like cattle being transported around.This company does not care about you or your trip. You pay cheap you get what you get.If you use this service it's a roll of the dice. If you don't care about being late arriving or possible delays leaving, no support or structured assistance in emergencies, possible sub par coaches then give it a go. It's cheap that's it. Its late arriving and departing and now mid journey I/we all have an idea how hopeless in-journey management is. It's been a nightmare. Missed connections, people worried and kids etc on the service.If you care to be punctual leaving and arriving and knowing your journey will be managed  well then plesse use a dependable service like national express. Hope someone sees this and is spared this disappointment and madness someday before booking.",09 October 2021
"Today 6th of October I supposed to…Today 6th of October I supposed to catch the megabus from newcastle to London at 6.05am but instead it came nearly 6.30 am. I'm not complaining for the late but because I've seen the bus driver passed close by the bus stop but I don't know why, he went different other directions and finally came late. Then after being late, at one the stop after nothingam, we have to wait for the change of the driver but he wasn't there as nobody of the staff knew it where he was. After another wasting of time, the driver appeared and he gets to Victoria Station at around 2.30 pm when he supposed gets there by 1.30 pm. I wouldn't complaining if it was for traffic but the fact that their wasn't any traffic and the drivers service its shocking. I used to get this bus at thse times because usually it came earlier instead of 10-20min sometimes. I was better off if I got national express",06 October 2021
"Cheap for a reasonI booked a 6.45am bus for yesterday from Loughborough University Ashby Rd, that didn’t arrive. My partner was on his way to Birmingham so dropped me at the stop. He had the hindsight to wait. When it was clear that the bus wasn’t coming I started to panic as it was dark, with no means of getting a taxi to anywhere.In the end I was forced to get a train which cost me £95.Mega bus refuses any refund as you have to be delayed by 2 hrs. I should think after 10 mins you would know the bus wasn’t coming. They informed me that the bus did actually come but was late and if I’d gone on social media I would have found that out. Oh silly me for not thinking of that when I was standing in the dark and freezing cold at 6.45am yesterday morning!They are  a disgrace. The only reason I use them sometimes is because they can be quicker than National Express.The bus is usually freezing. I dread to think what would happen in an emergency as there doesn’t seem to be any backup, which I found out last year with a suspected Covid sufferer on the bus. Driver didn’t have a clue what to do. No thermometer either. Just decided to pull over and treat the person like a leper. Everyone had to get off and he couldn’t get through to his office. Only office open was Glasgow. We were stranded for hours while we waited for an ambulance. I left London Victoria at 6.45pm and finally got to Loughborough at 12.30am after a National Express coach rescued us.

"Do not use, ever!Glasgow-London and backBoth buses were operated by Megabus. 1st of all, free Wi-Fi was advertised as available on both journeys - there wasn't any, on both of them. The buses are overall terrible, toilet facility on my return bus had no water to wash hands. Very uncomfy seats as well, it's just painful after a short while.The drivers are the worst part. Very rude, announcing stuff over intercom like on a preschool trip. Never ever in my life did I encounter something like this on a bus. No covid/hygiene means at all, driver let obviously sick people on the bus, coughing and sneezing all the time. Again - very rude in every possible way, treating passengers really bad. My fiance had a Sainsbury's bag with a couple of sandwiches inside for the way. The driver stopped her and started to look through her bag, literally put his hand inside to search it. This is completely unacceptable, he had absolutely no right to do this - and no reason as well.I have no words to describe how disgusted we both are with our journey both ways. The price was low, but if I knew how horrible my experience will be, I wouldn't pay £5 for it.",02 October 2021
"DO NOT use these absolute slackers. Embarrassingly badThe WORST customer service I’ve ever encountered, and that’s not a statement I make lightly.Not enough that our bus was 1 hour 45 minutes late leaving us stranded in the city centre upon arrival to the destination (explained to their customer service team, didn’t give one), they then refused a refund on the basis that they ‘only issue refunds for delays of 120 minutes or more.’ The return journey was then late by an hour. Not helped by the staff’s worrying lack of urgency.Not to mention the random stops added to the journey which were not disclosed on the website when booking. I’m all for surprises but not ones which involve a 20 minute detour on an already 1.5 hour late journey.Please don’t waste your time or money.

You walked into a puddle of dirty water over whole of the floor.Sheer lack of/incompetent Customer Service:Megabus cancelled my return sector, due to shortage of drivers (which their T&C's allow them to do). In the Advisory email, they asked me to reschedule or request a refund. I went to do so only to find that my ORIGINAL journey times (which they cancelled) WAS still available! However, after ""adding to cart"" nothing happened. I emailed them and they advised their system was down. By the time they notified me that the system was back up, my slot was NO LONGER AVAILABLE!My argument is that they shouldn't have cancelled a contracted journey which WAS still operating, and for which I had a confirmed booking. Underhanded practice whereby a new Booker received my slot - but at their new, increased price!Agent said ""Sorry"" - then they've failed to respond to communications since.I appreciate they're cheaper than National Express - so they get bums on seats - but not necessarily long term repeat bookers when they treat their customers so shoddily.

"Megabus Aberdeen to Glasgow returnMegabus Aberdeen to Glasgow return - 1st leg, on time, quick journey time on the direct service which is similar to the car. Older double decker bus but clean, leather seats were comfortable upstairs but without recline facility. WiFi worked although no streaming of music is permitted which I think is standard these days. Power sockets were both dead at my seat which was disappointing. Return journey was on time, fabric seats were very uncomfortable, too narrow, recline facility under arm rest I would guess hadn’t be cleaned for months and was shocking. WiFi and power usb worked but position of usb socket is right at your knee so is poorly located. Floor was dirty around my upstairs seat, the noise of what I presume was an aircon unit in the vacinity was I’d guess around 70 dB and droned the whole journey. The ticket cost is the same as the cost of petrol for this journey so I don’t see them being able to attract people from their cars with this service. I wonder when the last Stagecoach Board member did the customer experience journey, I’d guess never, pretty poor show overall and I couldn’t describe any aspect as ‘Mega’.",27 September 2021

YES NO SEAT NUMBERS ANYWHERE BUT WE HAD PAID 2£ EXCESS FOR THE SEATS.Thirdly zero maintenance of the toilet my girlfriend went to use the toilet and it was overflowing with urine and stuff.The journey from London to Edinburgh was horrible because we were 2 hours delayed because of a drug addict. Some people had to jump him out of the bus and some people were supporting on yo the bus finally we left the guy on the road and reached Glasgow first then to Edinburgh.

In the first, there was a drink guy who created hell loads of nuisance, the driver never heard anything nor act until things escalated, later the drunk guy was pulled outside and he tried to puncture the tyres. The seats are so uncomfortable that it either doesn't incline or your feet gets numb due to very very uncomfortable leg space. Do not recommend at all! Price seems to decieve it, but nothing is more important than a little comfort during lung journey. Definitely not going to book this company ever!",26 September 2021
"Cowboys. I had to walk because driver exceeded his hours.They were short of a driver so they got one with a coach from another company. However he had already worked some hours before, so when we approached my destination we had to stop for half an hour at a busy junction. This was because a 20-minute traffic delay meant he had worked for too long and ""needed to take a break"". This probably explains why he was weaving in and out of traffic on the motorway beforehand, he was in a hurry to arrive on time but failed. As we were just two miles from my destination I got out and walked. Others were left complaining but the driver refused to budge. Also, I was not going to the final destination, so Megabus must have known he would have needed a break en-route. It just didn't happen at the intermediate stop as they had planned. Looking at Trustpilot reviews, the only good service in the UK is National Express who are streets ahead of the rest.",24 September 2021
I wish I can give them 0 starI wish I can give them 0 star.  Caught the bus from London to Glasgow biggest mistake over my life. Driver was useless he let in a drunk guy who was definitely high on something.  Guy continued to get aggressive and driver ignored it.  Eventually a few guys jumped him and held him down and demand he gets thrown off bus. That's when stupid driver stopped to allow him to be kicked off bus.  Guy crawled under bus and tried to puncture tyres would never have happened if he was refused entry.  I was on night service but selfish people continued to play music throughout journey which driver completely ignored.  Either he was deaf or ignorant to the rules.  Toilet was also not working.  Useless company get your act together and hire someone that can enforce rules.  He should be kicked out of the job. No Covid rules in force on this service. Will be complaining about everything.,22 September 2021

"Toilet (men)Megabus delivered on departure/arrival times. Seating was ok. My problem was the toilet. Was OK to start with. As the journey went on..bad. The problem is men. They think you can't sit down to do the toilet. It's hard enough on a bus for a female sitting doing the toilet, but standing!!. Guy's can't pee straight when the toilet is static, so why do they think they can do it on a moving bus!!!A wee 2 min check to clean up would be nice..or 2 workers are on the bus, 1 having a wee check, and a sign asking all passengers to sit in the toilet.After the toilet ordeal I don't think I will be using Megabus again.",15 September 2021
Excellent driverYou get what you pay for!  I was recently travelling to Birmingham and due to the M6 been a carpark we were running late for me to catch the last tain home.  I asked the driver and explained my predicament and he replied I'm going past your train station I'll drop you off. Made it with 10min to spare. For £11 all in its hard to grumble.

We ( myself and my wife ) had to sit on the bus for over an hour on Hill St. in Birmingham - just sat there bored out of our skulls and frustrated.   The driver had announced He was waiting for another bus to arrive, to collect THEIR passengers!   What had THAT got to do with our highly ( these days ) paid journey?   Upon booking, it said we'd arrive in Manchester at 16.15 pm - we arrived around 6pm.   It was double the time ALSO when going down to Coventry.   Despite the lower price ( slightly ) of Megabus, we're going to use the train always now.  Their service has flown RIGHT downhill - shockingly bad.   An offer of a refund would have been the right thing for them to do.    £20 there, £20 return. HUH!",17 August 2021

The only seats available were single seats, each next to strangers. No Covid restrictions in place, every seat was full and not one other person was wearing a face covering. Myself and my partner are both NHS frontline workers, this simply isn’t acceptable. We got off at the first stop off and paid for a train for the rest of our journey. I paid well over the normal price for our tickets because of advertised safety measures and reduced capacity.",16 August 2021

"Baggage unfairnessI was traveling yesterday from Glasgow to Manchester Airport at 22:45. I had 3 baggages with my belongings because I was returning to Greece permanently. There were many people and they had as priority 1 baggage each passenger. Finally only mine left out while other people put 2 each. I told them that I will pay the extra cost for each baggage (while the others didn't) to fit them and rearrange the others in order to fit because they were just thrown in with many gaps in between, even to take them in the bus because of my situation. I was desperate because I already paid 80 pounds for these baggage to flight them in Greece and that I would leave Glasgow for ever and had no place to leave them and they did not want to take this into account. Imagine a picture of only 2 baggage left out and me trying to convince them with all these arguments and offering to pay the extra money too. This company is not serious and their policy has no ethics in specific situations,without caring about people . Also the staff was no helpful and willing to discuss. I would not suggest this company at all for any kind of traveling, especially for important trips.That was the last time I used this company and highly suggest everyone not to prefer it.",04 August 2021

Megabus always lateAlthough the megabus seems good value for money be prepared to travel for a whole day. My partner travels from Weston to Birmingham which should take 1.45 max. However consistently the bus is around and hour minimum to Two hours late with a very long stop at Bristol each time which is not advertised and therefore the bus times are absolutely consistently late and advertising times is pointless and against trading standards. Of course weather and time of year could be taken into consideration or accidents but with the level of consistent lateness these are not excuses. Use the train if your time is precious.,30 July 2021
"Excellent experience at this timeI am a regular Megabus user and have had had all sort of experiences but at his time was exceptional. I received a sad phone call and had to go asap to London from Cardiff which happened to be on the 27th with the 6.30am ride. There was a bit of hiccup but the driver solved the problem in a professional way. Not mentioning his driving skills which made the journey smooth and safe. I wish all the drivers would have this calm, excellent attitude for the role.Thank you Lee again, one of the best driver",29 July 2021

The departure point on the email as-well-as the website (in the tracking option) was stated as “Finchley Road Station, Stop CL”.However, despite waiting for more than an hour, the bus never showed up. This is extremely frustrating and unprofessional from their end. Even if the bus was terminated or the point was changed, I was supposed to be informed by email or atleast, the status of trip should have been updated on the “track coach” option on website.Not only did I underwent extreme discomfort in the rain, but had to book another from National Express late night.",29 July 2021

"I have traveled over 30 times with…I have traveled over 30 times with mega-bus and EVERYTIME there is an issue, i think only 1 time i had a decent journey.They close the doors 1-5 mins BEFORE the scheduled time to leave, so if you're even 1 minute early they will leave without you, one time i was stood while i waved at the driver to stop, he continued to close the luggage compartment and close the doors when he could have let me on, he left without me.This has happened 3x to me, still i give them a chance but never again.All the bad reviews are spot on, if the bus isn't stinking of pi$$ and $hit from the filthy toilets, the AC isn't working and its boiling in the summer, or if you travel in the winter the heaters don't work and you're freezing your t!ts off. They never arrive on time so if you have an appointment in London for 3pm, and your ticket says you will get there for 1:45pm, they will probably get you there at 4pm.The drivers are ALL rude, always turn up with a big a$$ chip on their shoulders, moaning and groaning.I'd sit more comfortably on a cactus than on their rock hard seats and the customer service line is full of useless dumba$$es who probably went to college and studied 'health and social care' only to drop out because they got pregnant at 16 and named their kid Connor, then ended up working for your customer service lines.thank you for nothing, goodbye and good riddance",30 June 2021
"Can be good, but can also be awlfulI booked a return trip from London victoria to Middlesbrough on megabus. I had booked about a week before travelling and had reserved extra leg room seats both ways as I am 6ft 6 and it's a pretty long journey. The outward journey was good, seats were reserved as booked. There were lots of passengers on board not wearing masks at all and that left me very uncomfortable. The return journey unfortunately was very under whelming, no effort had been made at all to number or reserve seats that people had paid for already, I got told by the driver after showing my reservation ticket just to sit towards the back of the bus. I was cramped up and very un comfortable for the entire journey. Very few passengers were bothering with masks even the ones who were sleeping, I have to say I was very happy to finally get off at London victoria. I reported this to megabus and got a refund of £2.00 for my troubles. I think next time I will be looking at other coach companies a bit closer, megabus was a let and it wasn't even a cheap let down.",15 June 2021
"Oh my days, never again.The first alarm signals were raised when I saw a bulletin on the Megabus website, informing people that they should now expect people next to them o_O. In line with the restrictions, this was only between stops in England. The route in question was the M11 service from Glasgow to London, with two stops at Manchester Corporation Street and Manchester Airport.All was generally decent until I got to Buchanan Bus Station in Glasgow. The coach was scheduled to depart at 22:45, ""was"" being the keyword here.22:30: No sign of the coach, 22:35, 22:40 and still no sign. Then at 22:44 the big blue coach rolled in from the depot, fashionably late. I thought to myself that there was probably congestion and that we'll get away quickly. That didn't happen.The drivers decided to spend a few minutes having a chat to the bus station marshallers before eventually opening the doors and hold and letting us board. By the time the crowd of about 25 got their luggage on, we were already around 10 minutes late. We eventually left at 23:00, 15 minutes late. That's not much of a delay and I was optimistic that we would make it up.I understand diversions happen, but the drivers should give some information about how long we should expect to be delayed.We then hit the morning traffic coming into London.In total the diversion around Manchester and the traffic made us around 1hr 15 minutes late.Again, with my point about giving out more information, a few passengers were getting very irate during the slow crawl into London as we all just wanted off as well as some fresh air. Megabus do not offer comfort stops, which makes me tempted to take National Express.My experience was that dismal, I decided to opt for the train home. I'd only give one star, but the extra star is because all the facilities were in excellent working order.",12 June 2021

Then as we arrived at Perth I was unsure if we had to change bus to get to Glasgow as my phone was out of battery so I could no longer see my ticket, as I went down to ask him if we had to change to get to Glasgow he rudely said “no, that’s why it says Glasgow on the front” I am absolutely disgusted by this level of rudeness and appalling customer service.

"Travelling home the coach was freezing…Travelling home the coach was freezing so none of us customers could warm up or even sleep, we were travelling from 10pm to 7am the coldest times.. to make matters worse driver would have a cigarette leaving doors open so the coach was even colder.. was not a nice travel home as I have a metal rod in my back i felt like I was having spasms the whole journey where the cold had got to me that badly!

"Me and my family traveledMe and my family traveled on the 21/08/20 and we returned on the 29/08/20 was an excellent journey both ways and each driver we had were very polite and helpful, We had my nana with us who is 79yo and they helped her on and off the bus and made us really very safe and secure on both journey's will definitly be traveling with megabus uk again.... One driver was called Ben and he was really friendly and helpful and so polite we had an issue with the charger ports onboard the bus but he apoligized for the inconvinence.... It was a very relaxing and comfy journey and great value for money 😃😃😃",30 August 2020
"I have used Megabus for yearsI have used Megabus for years, it's a shame to see such horrible reviews on here, with Megabus you get what you pay for, if you want luxury travel go somewhere else. It's affordable, If you miss your bus they usually let you get on the next one if there's space for an extra fiver. You won't get this with other service providers. No it doesn't stop regularly but I would rather get to Swansea from London in 5 hours not 7.",28 August 2020

This service is horrible can't even recommend it to an enemyThis service is horrible can't even book tickets on their website. I tried 10 times and failed all the 10 times. Also each time I tried the prices went up (From £61 to £115). I had you use another method of transport because there weren't any other coach service on that route. A very bad and unethical company with a monopoly.,21 August 2020

"Bad serviceBus which was meant to be travelling from Plymouth to London broke down near exeter, had to wait an hour for a replacement which only went as far as Bristol so had to wait for and get on another bus to London. Journey was delayed by almost 2 hours and the replacement driver was not sympathetic at all to those travelling further than bristol. Drivers from Bristol to London apologised but many people missed connection and the journey was meant to be direct but we had to get on 3 buses total which was confusing and inconvenient",24 July 2020
Appalling experienceThe driver was reluctant to help me with my luggage I'm not sure if this had anything to do with my Asian ethnicity as he gladly helped passengers belonging to his ethnicity . I stood in the queue to show my ticket but the driver ignored me and attended person standing behind me.Paying extra for seat reservation seemed pointless as its not being adhered to.,23 July 2020
"Just walk or get a train thank me laterI think walking from glasgow to Inverness barefoot, while being whipped like a horse would have been a more enjoyable journey. Good luck trying to sit in the seats comfortably for more than 2 minutes if you're over 175cm as well. I also think thay to get a job working as a megabus driver you must have an iq lower than 57. If I could give less than 1 star I would I put into words properly how awful these busses and the drivers are.",22 July 2020
Thank you to the bus driverI took the bus from Perth-Inverness on 12/07/20 which only arrived at midnight. The bus driver really kindly waited with me for 15mins before my I got picked up. Being alone at night is often quite scary but he put my mind at ease.,19 July 2020
"1st time with Megabus - May even be the last!Called a Megabus representative in advance to discuss luggage allowance and advised to buy 2 seats for a family member due to total weight, which we did. Upon waiting for the Megabus yesterday morning from Birmingham to Manchester Airport, firstly the bus arrived at 8am sharp, so departure was definitely going to be late....no real bother...however this is when things took a turn for the worst.The driver voiced his assumptions stating that one piece of luggage was 35kg, to which i replied it was slightly deviated from 20kg - was 'told' that 20kg is the limit to which i discussed that we spoke to a rep beforehand and at no point during the conversation was this mentioned. He advised that the suitcase will need to be left behind or ""i will need to drive to the airport"".After further clarification, he decided to call someone (not sure who, however the person on the other line had obviously signed the luggage off ) and the driver decided to not disclose the full conversation we previously had about  what we discussed with the representative to the person on the phone. As we tried to insist he disclose this information, we were instead greeted by the palm of his hand raised mid air (extremely rude!) which was followed by ""dont interfere when im in a call"".Following the call he insisted it was to his discretion and that he would allow my family member on 'as a one off' making us feel like he was doing us a favour in a extremely degrading manner - so much so that he insisted to carry on emphasising this and further extending the waiting time for departure.The driver was obviously spiteful as he followed with a barrage of assumptions stating that ""your airline will not accept all this luggage and will charge you £144 excess fees"" - not sure where this information came from as the weight of the luggage is within their guidelines - again this seemed out of spite.Passenger was already distressed due to personal issues, and further exacerbated by his unnecessary demeanor.Would advise Megabus to brush up their drivers customer service skills.Just to add to the above. Following the drop off to the airport my family member even 'thanked' the driver for his cooperation due to the misunderstanding, and was instead told to talk to customer service if she had an issue.Seems like customer service is only apparent in the office, not with the driver.",16 July 2020
"Bus were delayed but...Bus were delayed, but I were too :) Unfortunately, I were more late than the bus. Woman from staff on the bus stop told me that I can wait for another and speak with the driver to let me in. It worked! I didn't needed to buy another ticket!",14 July 2020

"Great!I've used Megabus a few times. Aberystwyth to London. I've done, London to Coventry. London to Exeter. London to York. London to Oxford. Before FlixBus, I've used Megabus to go from London to Rotterdam. Also when I was in Belgium I went to Luxembourg. Never had any problems, it has always been pleasant and easy. Prices are decent and very affordable, some prices are surprisingly cheap! With all the drivers I've had so far, everyone has been very friendly and helpful. Usually the buses are on time, sometimes due to traffic, some delays do happen. During the start of the UK lock down, they automatically refunded my sister when they cancelled her journey back to London a few days prior to her trip so she had to stay in Wales, which was for the better. Very good of them to issue an automatic refund. Overall, great service 5/5.",03 July 2020

"NEVER AGAIN!Oh dear, what a double disaster.  Used Megabus for the first (and last) time as journeys were both unpleasant.We paid the extra for reserved seats ""between the wheels"" and on the opposite side to the sunlight as one of us has an eye problem. Driver checked our tickets and let us onto bus where we found not too clear seat numbering, but when we did we found a large male sat in our reserved seats ( he had his bags on the other seat).  We politely pointed out that he was in our reserved seats but he said ""sit somewhere else-there's spare seats"".  I went back to the driver and told him, but amazingly he told us the same thing and to sit down as we were blocking the gangway!!We reluctantly sat down and when all had boarded was told by driver not to make a mess, no food consumption allowed, no hot drinks allowed and only to use the toilet in a really dire emergency!The journey started but was accompanied by loud rock music throughout from the driver and STIFLING heat all the way. Never been so pleased to see Stratford!Return journey was just the same with reserved seats being taken and driver again unwilling to ask people to move.  What a rip-off.NEVER AGAIN - back to National Express!",31 March 2020

I hope you all manage to get refunded along with anyone else affected by this. Best of luck everyone & stay safe. x That means we do not make non essential travel trips Megabus! Do the right thing and please refund all your customers affected by the current lockdown!",31 March 2020
Encouraging non essential travel!!!!We have the same issue as Jackie and William.We had a trip to London booked for 17th-19th April for a concert/sightseeing. This has obviously now been cancelled following the governments advice for essential travel only. There is a post on Facebook dated 19th March from their MD stating refunds would be offered for anyone with pre booked tickets 23rd March to 20th April but still refusing to issue one. Intend taking matter further but beware if you are booking anything with them for coming months,30 March 2020
"Wish I could give 0 stars...MONEY GRABBING, SLY, DESPICABLE MOVE MEGABUS!!So our concert in London for april 7th has been cancelled, I visited the site yesterday and it clearly stated that if you were booked up until April 30th you could get a full refund! I though brilliant and emailed your team, I've had a reply today ... You have conveniently changed your terms and conditions / rescheduling policy over night so that now I am unable to get any refund for my tickets only to change the dates. I get an email back saying you can't refund me because I paid £3 of my trip in vouchers.... What a SLY and VILE move by the company taking complete advantage of people who find themselves in this situation. You are lining your own pockets in this awful situation.AVOID they will take your money and not give a single thought to their customers as long as they have your money!",22 March 2020

All I heard was 'we do not do refunds'. No exceptions. I understand the rules are helpful in a normal situation, however this is definitely not normal, and nobody could have predicted a global pandemic! Shame on you Megabus, I guess I will not be using your services anymore as I cannot afford to be treated like this.",15 March 2020
"I've regularly used Megabus over the…I've regularly used Megabus over the years as a route from Sheffield to London. Always received good service and no delays. This was until last Monday 9th March when I experienced a random situation. I boarded at London Victoria and we left on time. Journey was going well until we got to Watford Gap where the driver was told to go back to Toddington (42 miles away) to rescue stranded customers from a different coach. When we eventually got back to Watford Gap we were over an hour behind. Then to top it off we hit traffic near Leicester, at 11pm and didn't move for an hour and a half. Reached Sheffield at 2.40am, 2 & 1/2 hours late! I ended up sending a complaint email as I felt the service on this occasion was poor. Happy to say that I got a positive response and will be using their services again. Seeing a lot of negative comments, I can totally understand. There's definitely areas of improvement needed but at least Megabus does respond to the reviews.",13 March 2020
"NOT TRUSTWORTHY AT ALL! WORST EXPERIENCE!I just had the WORST experience EVER!Megabus is know for their cheap bus journeys, right? If you book a trip with MegaBUS  you would think you book a BUS JOURNEY, right? WRONG! I booked a trip from London to Nottingham. The booking process was easy and simple. My journey to Nottingham was nice, I spent a nice day in Nottingham and when I had to make my way back home I checked my booking confirmation and checked where I had to go to get on the coach back home. I was standing at the coach pick up station and was waiting for the coach to come. I was supposed to get on at 9:25pm. I was waiting and waiting and waiting.. 9:40pm I called the Customer Service line (which was an experience on it's own). The agent from the Customer Service that for my return I booked a train journey... a TRAIN JOURNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Obviously I missed that train by this time and it was nearly 10pm, I was stuck in Nottingham, far away from home and there was nothing they could do.My complain is about that during my booking process there was NO INFORMATION about a train journey for return, nor was this clearly mentioned on my booking confirmation. Once the guy told me that I booked a train journey I checked my booking confirmation again and there I could see 2 very tiny, not very visible words ""train journey"". You will only notice that once you know it. It was definitely not clear at all and my booking confirmation for the departure and return looked exactly the same and there was even a link to a map to guide you to your pick up point which clearly told me to go to the coach pick up station! I am wondering how would I have been able to get to the train platform without a train ticket since I only had a Megabus confirmation?At this point I missed the train and I didn't know how to get back home to London at this time. I had no choice and had to buy a regular train ticket which cost me over 70 GBP, I had to take 2 different trains and back in London I had to take 2 night buses as by the time I was in London it was already very late and no underground was running anymore.I made my way home from Nottingham to London at 10pm and I arrived home at 3:15am !!!Cheap, easy trip turned out very expensive and very long and exhausting!",10 March 2020
Megabus is an Absolutely appalling…Megabus is an Absolutely appalling service!Moody busy drivers and the Victoria Bus station staff are no betterthe 7:30pm coach yesterday was 90 mins late no one informed us of this and when you try to say anything to megabus they don’t want to hear it.So Victoria to Gloucester arrived 2 hours after it was supposed toMeaning I had no option but to walk to my nephews house as the buses had already stopped for the night.I would advise everyone not to travel with megabus and to instead travel with National Express who are way better and on time.,07 March 2020
"Disappointing1. Man in hi - vis loading luggage on arrival was so rude was told he was not waiting on anyone when his was due to leave till another 10 minutes.2.

Toilet was blocked so could not use , so when stopping at Dundee was told not allowed to use bathroom out with the bus stopping as “ we didn’t have time to wait “Very unsatisfied with the service I’m sure 5 minutes of the time of people using the bathroom wouldn’t of made anyone late.",06 March 2020
"Cold, cramped JourneyRecently took a journey between Leeds and Inverness. Ridiculously packed out. It says the Megabus is comfortable ... no such thing. Sat in cramped seats, with very little movement allowed, the air-conditioning was on full pelt, no way of turning out off - so half way into the journey I couldn't feel my right side and my right leg got cramp.  This isn't great when I already have a back and breathing problem.When we finally got to our destination, I spent a whole day in bed due to the fact I was that cold and in pain.Megabus, I know you are a budget service, but if you are wanting customers to come back and/or even recommend you ... then please, SORT YOURSELVES OUT.",02 March 2020
MISSED BUS TIME DISCOUNTI do not like the bus fairs of this company as I see them as expensive especially when one missed the bus.  Why do people lose everything from the paid fair and not even top up to the expensive fair.  I missed the bus twice as the student due to delay of other connecting busses and I had to pay almost the same return fair I paid.  This is a reap off especially to students. AND THIS MAKES THIS BUS OPTION MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER CHOICE BEFORE CHOSEN THE UPFRONT RETURN TICKET.,02 March 2020

Panicking a bit of whats going on... And explaining him my data just run out,maybe i won t be able to provide him the actual ticket.. He was ensuring me he won t let me in.. But wasn t the case as I was scrolling down and luckily the ticket opened.I asked him if he could check it again and why is he doing such a big hustle while he was keep shouting and talking provocative, eventually he was threatening me he won t let me in if i am not shutting up.I am so mesmerised of what happened I want to file a complain at least the company and the customers to get an ideea of what kind of people they are working with.If you can check those cameras from the bus which I don t think you re bothered to check...you would see what type of customer service is provided by some of your staff",29 February 2020
"I regularly use megabus (probably twice…I regularly use megabus (probably twice a month) to travel from London to Cardiff, Norwich and Manchester to see my friends at their unis. As a young student, megabus is definitely one to go for as it provides simply the most affordable and convenient travel up and down the country.I have never had a problem with delays - the buses always get me to the location at the time it says on the reservation and they are never late to leave either. And there is a lot of choice when it comes to the time of your travel. The buses are very regular and go overnight.Regarding the price and service, you definitely get what you pay for. The drivers are always friendly and helpful. The toilet is, well, a small toilet that you would expect on a coach. It works. The seating is sometimes awkward because even though you've reserved it you'll probably still have to argue with someone sitting in your seat.Once I have travelled and the bus was way too cold and could have done with the heating on (it was January).Of course travelling by bus is a lot slower than trains. But where a return from London to Cardiff on the train could cost me £100, I'd rather use megabus where I will only be paying about £17-£30.What I would say is I would like there to be another stop in London or Essex. I live in Essex and every time I need to travel somewhere in the country I have to spend an hour on the underground getting to London Victoria first.",26 February 2020

Had some awful experiences where they blasted the heating the whole time but have no working air con so the bus is like an oven and I had to press myself up against the cold windows so I didn’t pass out. Toilet is absolutely vile, water doesn’t even work in the sink most of the time so you’re stuck with soap on your hands. Always turns up late.

Told to form a queue (I was first at bus stop but one of last to board). Second driver(Paul) was the best driver I've had on Megabus during my 7 years of travel with you. He was polite and informative about the journey and safety regulations, politely reminded travellers to be considerate of other travellers when using mobile devices, listening to music etc which I felt had a very positive impact on the pleasantness of my journey which was 10 1/2 hrs with delays. Third driver made no interaction with passengers- not even telling us to put safety belts on.    So the best overall journey thanks to Paul. I just.

"Pleasantly surprisedI noticed that the train I intended to travel on between Perth & Glasgow was being replaced by a bus due to weather conditions. Rather than pay Scotrail £27.50 for a train ticket (+ £6 for parking) so that I could travel on a bus I decided to try Megabus.My Megabus ticket cost £15.60 and included free parking so overall I saved almost £18.It'd been a long time since I'd travelled by coach and my memories were not particularly happy ones but I needn't have worried, the coach was clean, comfortable and fast, just as fast as the train would have been, and considerably faster than the Scotrail bus replacement service.I won't be using the train again anytime soon, I'm a Megabus convert. If, like me, you haven't travelled by coach since the 20th century and have unpleasant memories of those days, it's time to give the bus another chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",18 February 2020
Far better than national expressNever had any problems travelling on London to Bradford route and London to Norwich route. Megabus plus which takes you halfway by train is superb for the price.

Its ludicrous. I've literally had nothing to eat or drink since 11am (Glasgow Departure)Megabus, get your act together. It is NOT hard to stop at a Motorway Service Station on the journey. I counted at least 11 Service Stations.The disembarking was an absolute shambles. The drivers had no control over the luggage, anyone was allowed to just grab any bag.

I approached the driver of that bus and showed him the tickets. He told us to get in. It turned out that it's was the wrong bus, so we got off the bus in Dundee and had to buy new tickets from another operator for £35. When I complained to the driver, he was cutting me off, not letting me finish any sentence telling me it's not his fault. I asked him what's next? How can we get to Edinburgh? But he was really ignorant and left us stranded. I sent a message to the customer care and waiting for their answer.

I couldn't find the booking on my phone so they printed my booking which allowed me to board easily.The bus left on time and the driver + his attendant were very polite + helpful. There was some delay + the driver apologized from time to time + updated us on the expected arrival time. I thought that service was very good and so i booked another trip. The only drawbacks are: no toilets, no stopping (except for change of drivers) and inadequate signs for locating the coaches. So these coaches are not for everyone. Now I know I can ask the staff outside as they are very knowledgeable and willing to share as I found in Peter from Oxford Tube. Thank again  Peter + yr 2 colleagues!",06 February 2020
"The worst customer service I have ever…The worst customer service I have ever received from Driver to complaints. Truly awful.I used Megabus to return home at Christmas time from London, as I do 9/10 times a year.The service on this particular journey was so bad and the driver so agressive to myself and other customers that I felt compelled to make a complaint, Megabus have not responded to this incident and it was over a month ago now.I have been using megabus to travel from my family home in Gloucestershire and London for years and after the service I received last month I do not expect to use the service again.When leaving London on the 21/12/2019 I experienced your driver starting our journey by rudely shouting at another passenger for using the toilet before we had set off. It wasn’t until I was set to leave the bus that I was also met with hostility.I stepped off the bus a stop early, as the bus was 35 minutes late and knew that my alternative transport from there would allow me to get home on time. At this point the driver refused to let me take my bag from the hold and aggressively shouted at me to return to the bus and sit down. I expressed that I was allowed to leave the bus and requested my bag, he repeated my statement back to me mockingly, blocking me from my bag and then stated that he wouldn’t move any bags to help. I expressed that it was my property and he again shouted at me to return to the bus. My requests were met with hostility for another 2-3 minutes. At this point I decided to retrieve my bag myself resulting in me having to climb into the hold and move bags on my own to find mine, your driver watched me do this the entire time. Once I retrieved my bag I asked your driver if his actions were necessary to which he responded that he didn’t care.This complaint was sent to Megabus over a month ago. In my experience the drivers are extremely aggressive/rude and megabus do not care about this or their customers",30 January 2020
"This happened to my husband tonight…This happened to my husband tonight supposing to travel from Coventry to Cambridge directly which was supposed to take 2 hours.In the middle of the way, the driver asked everyone to get off the bus, and when he asked the driver, he told my husband that he should go to the London. My husband was so angry about it and started taking a photo of the driver, and can you imagine that the driver beat him in the mouth.Finally he went to London and there was no bus for Cambridge.All this costed him 60 GBP  extra.We will follow this issue till the end. Megabus should understand that they can not treat their customers with disrespect. We will teach them.",24 January 2020
I am on a journey london to glasgow…I am on a journey london to glasgow over 10 hours but before arrival. the driver has stopped to smoke and locked the doors so we can not get out to smoke or get water on more than one occasion on this journey. Toilet is horrendous can't sit on the actual toilet seat as its covered in urine n smells eye stingingly bad. I have a migrane as I need some air and refreshments. Don't think I've had a journey where my needs have been so neglected before won't be using again. I payed over 90 pounds for a single journey for me n a friend. And am sat hear feeling ill dehydrated and hungry. Please do not use mega bus. National express is such a better experience. Waste of money this mega bus journey was and will probly take one of my days on my holiday to recover from the journey. Drivers should stop atleast once durring a long journey over 5 hours it's just a humane choice to make. Heavily disappointed mega bus thank god my return tickets are with national express!,24 January 2020

Thank you very much MegaBus",20 January 2020
"Not very happy with Megabus customer…Not very happy with Megabus customer service. It was our very first time using this coach company to travel from Cardiff to London at 6am in the morning. We arrived on time with 2 minutes to spare but was very confused as to where exactly the bus stop was as we saw a megabus (unknown to us that it was out of service) parked in another bus stop literally around the corner from where we actually needed to be! By the time we realised that, it was bang on 6am and the bus we were meant to be on was driving past us on its way to London. So not only did the driver not even wait 1 minute for any passengers that could of been literally a minute out of range but we had to wait another hour for the next bus and pay for new tickets. When we got in touch with customer service when their offices opened, we were told we would not be getting a refund for our tickets that we did not use. It was not our fault as we were there on time, literally around the corner and mislead by an out of service megabus in the wrong bus stop!",13 January 2020
"Very Unfriendly Staff with Bad Manners, My Actual Rating is Zero on Customer ServiceThe employee who checked the tickets when I was getting on the bus, was incredibly rude for no reason what so ever! I answered the driver with smiley face as I was in a good mood. However, he interrupted by saying 'it's not about being silly' in a very unfriendly body language ... Such unnecessary rudeness?!.Don't take your anger out on passengers/customers! and this is not  the first time I have travelled with Megabus and realised bad behaviour, as if they never trained their staff to behave in good manners and provide professional services to tourist/visitors.Now I am still on the Bus from London, 15:30 M11 Manchester, however couldn't wait until I arrive to write this negative review, I'm very very disappointed.I usually don't prefer/recommend traveling with Megabus, however, from this experience today Sunday, I believe/decided not to consider Megabus or leave it the least of my travel options.As if ... you passengers/tourist who pay us lower, don't expect any customer service but just some bad manners, that's shame!And it worth to mention that there were not many passengers on the bus, and it was 10 minutes before the trip time. They got a chance to show the minimum/beginners customer service skills and show good manners, as they represent their company!?I am very very unhappy.",12 January 2020
"The bus driver was incredibly rude for…The bus driver was incredibly rude for no reason what so ever! Not what you want to have to deal with at 9:15 in the morning. When I gave him my suitcase to put in at the bottom of the coach, he asked if it was heavy and I said ""No, it's not that bad"", Then he raised his voice and practically shouted ""YES OR NO?!"" in my face. Such unncessary rudeness. Don't take your anger out on customers as if you're not being paid to do that job! Also this is the second time I have travelled with Megabus and the second time that the bus has been late both arriving and departing. Will not be using them again.",09 January 2020

About 30 mins ago, air con, goes on full blast and it isnow in the high 80's.  Not joking and very unpleasant.  Ine chap goes down to adk for it to be turned down, driver says no!!!! Are you actually being serious?????   Toilets are also a no go area, so totally screwed if you drink to stay alive but god help you if you need a toilet. . Y son does this route on a regular basis, and up to this evening, we have had no reason to complain.  Very very  uncomfortable and .Update, heating went back to a comfortable level, other that that for the price i paid im very happy  to upgrade my review.",07 January 2020
Better than I thought. Sheffield To BirminghamI used MegaBus for the first time this Christmas period. I caught the bus from Sheffield to Birmingham and both trips were better than I expected. The drivers are friendly and the bus is clean. There are two USB ports on the seats just right for me and my son. There is also Free 200MB WiFi. I would definitely use MegaBus again and would recommend if you are looking for a cheap and comfy way to travel.,07 January 2020
"Quite possibly the worst experience…Quite possibly the worst experience we've had where buses are concerned. We booked a table & 2 seats months before travelling only to be told they weren't available because ""new"" buses were being put on the route. So the bus turns up and it is not new at all, it's an old converted National Express coach with the heating stuck on, we had to sit for 3 hours in a roasting bus (several passengers asked for it to be turned down). I think I've sweated less weight training in the gym! I felt sick and my clothes were damp with sweat by the time I got off. Same issue travelling back home! Not happy! 😡",05 January 2020
A disgraceA disgraceAlthough you can change the ticket there is no refund plus you have to pay 2.5 GBP for the change which CANNOT come from the ongoing balance - what a joke,02 January 2020
"I have used Megabus on several…I have used Megabus on several occasions for travelling from Glasgow to various cities such as Manchester, Newcastle and London.  The coaches have always been on time and have never encountered any rude drivers, in fact the polar opposite!  Toilets are as expected for coaches though I have seen far worse at festivals.The only niggle I have was when I caught an overnight bus from Glasgow to London.  It was just under an 8 hour journey ( daytime coach durations are understandably much longer due to traffic ) and I found sitting in a fixed position a bit uncomfortable ( the seats aren't the best for long journeys )and so I didn't quite get much of a sleep.  Nothing a decent travel pillow and cushion for my bum wouldn't help for my next overnight trip though :-)I would encourage comfort breaks for journeys which take over 5 hours to help passengers regain circulation to their legs as I felt stiff as cardboard when I deboarded that morning in London but again taking precautions like travel pillows will help avoid that.Thanks Megabus for the otherwise excellent service you provide!",28 December 2019

What the heck is the service? What should I do now? Will demand for a refund, seriously, please avoid Megabus!1st Follow-up : Now at 17:15, the bus has not shown up yet, I waited over 80mins and have to pay an extra to go by National Express in order to catch up the time, I have filed a complaint to Megabus against the no show and demanded for a full refund. Let’s see how they respond and will keep you guys updated.Last report : 9 Jan 2020, I have received a full refund from PayPal and apologies from Megabus, it is explained that the bus was late by 75 mins due to Christmas’s traffic.

TerribleI have used megabus for a while but was really disappointed last time roundThey try and fine you for any small technical breaches of their TCs and do not apply any discretion at all. Fines are disproportionate - mine was double the price of the ticket despite there being loads of space on the coachDrivers very rude and coach very crampedIt's cheap for a reason - it's the lowest way of travelling.Avoid Megabus at all costs - National Express is operated so much better and is only marginally more expensive.,21 December 2019
Bus was late driver was rude and unprofessionalBus was lateThe driver who spoke broken English told us we had 3 cases and therefore would have t pay for an extra seat as we was only allowed 2 cases for 2 peopleThe bus was dead only quarter full hardly busy however I asked where do I buy another seat from wheres the ticket booth and he didnt know I asked how much would it be he didnt know. He was rude and obnoxious and then proceeded to tell us if we dont buy a third seat he will leave our 3rd suitcase on the road and drive off !!I got annoyed and stated how unprofessional that response is and he told me I was rude and I clearly didnt want to get the bus ride today ! And what's Myanmar's attitude forHe then said fine I'll allow you a 3rd case and expected me to show gratitude and be thankful !!! Told me I should be grateful as he was doing US A FAVOUR !

Do NOT ever travel with themDo NOT ever travel with them. I have been tRavelling for 5 months and I have never experienced this bad customer service! Firstly their website shows different prices.. when I went to purchase a ticket it wouldn’t work numerous of times! Then when I went to the train station the next day it was nearly double the price. Everyone was extremelyRude! Didn’t care about my issue! I wanted themTo refund the price that was on the internet the day before.. they refuse you! It’s not their problem one of the ladies advised me. I was shocked with the 3 people I spoke to the way they didn’t even care about any customer service. Do not travel with them.

Horrible seats, not nearly enoigh room for legs nor shoulders, even for a small size guy.You almost get what you are paying for - but absolutely nothing more!This could be recommended for smaller trips - but not recommendable for anything more than 2 hour trips.2 stars for the price.Sorry, but I do hope this is my last trip with Megabus UK.",13 December 2019
"Worst service ever!Over 10 hours trip from London to Glasgow, with a delay of over half an hour! Not enough space between seats, making it impossible to move at all. You get on the bus and that's it for the next 10 hours. It doesn't stop anywhere so that passangers can rest like normal human beings. Horrible beyond believe! Avoid!

"Traveling to and from Newcastle from…Traveling to and from Newcastle from Cardiff and I have to say there were many things wrong. The seats are not made to sit in for any period longer than 30 mins. I paid extra for front seats and for a whole 6+ hours I was sat next to a window dripping on my shoulder, not being able to see out of any of the windows as the air con didn't work. The drivers kept stalling and there's was no chance of sleep because they'd break so suddenly constantly. The only thing I can say was decent about this trip wasn't even to do with the company, and that was one of the men checking tickets was kind enough to help a couple get their reserved seats off a person who sat in them.P.s I suggest you don't drink much before your trip as the toilets on the bus are tiny and disgusting.",05 December 2019
"Cheap not cheerfulHad booked a return ticket from Edinburgh to London. Booked an overnight bus thinking I’d be able to sleep on the way down. Absolutely not. Never been so uncomfortable travelling in my life. There’s no leg room and the seats feel like they’re at an acute angle. The toilet was absolutely disgusting, despite getting on at the first stop, clearly had not been cleaned inside the actual cubicle itself and only changed the waste over. The floor was wet with urine, which is unsurprising since there’s nothing for men to hold on to while they go. Even worse if you’re a woman because the toilet seat and surrounding looked like they’d seen wars.All of this could be overlooked for the cheap price if the bus didn’t also break down. Ended up stopped outside London in a bus park for about an hour while we waited for another bus (a far cleaner and more comfortable (non Megabus) to take us the last 45 minutes into Victoria coach station. Breakdowns seem to be a regular occurrence which you’d assume they’d get on top of. Likewise, they used to use Megabus sleepers for the journeys which they have stopped, if you still own the buses why would you not use them for the longest overnight journey you run?Long story short, even for the price it was not worth it. Ended up getting the train back but at least it was comfortable and the toilets wouldn’t give you cholera.",02 December 2019

"Stranded in London ALL NIGHT because of Megabus - not even a refundDO NOT USE MEGABUS!! We were supposed to take a 1am coach from London back home to Leeds. The gate number on the departure boards was wrong so we missed our coach even though we arrived early, followed the departure board and even tried to find someone to help to make sure (there were no members of staff available at all!!). We called the helpline, who did not help at all and offered us no assistance or alternative travel arrangements. We ended up stranded in London with nowhere to go for the whole night (which was pretty scary at points) and had to get the first train back home in the morning - we didn’t sleep for over 24 hours. I complained to Megabus, asking for our money back and our train tickets refunded. We received a callous response back insisting that since other passengers managed to find the coach it was somehow our fault that we missed it despite their departure board being wrong and there being no gate number on the ticket!! I am so upset that they didn’t take this seriously as being stuck in a coach station in the middle of the night was an awful experience. If you are considering using Megabus please don’t as it’s not worth the risk, there are lots of other coach companies who won't con you.",30 November 2019
Very Bad I wonder why Megabus requires…Very Bad I wonder why Megabus requires 7 hrs from Manchester to London but I found out that they use it collect other passengers on other travel times so that I had to wait in Manchester for two hours before we were then transferred into another coach I am not sure I meet-up with my appointmentVery Bad and I will never take your service anymore,28 November 2019

I had a very very rude driver left me in tears I complained exactly a week ago over the phone they said someone will be in touch next couple of days.. I’ve heard nothing I’ve emailed them and they say they will respond in 48 hours still waiting.. for a driver to wish someone would die and stand in front of the bus he would gladly run me over and his final words was hope you die of cancer.. I thought this would have been a serious matter but still nothing.. the journey was fine but the driver was unbelievable.. mega bus please respond and tell me howLong before I hear something,09 November 2019

Your staffs attitude is absolutely SHOCKING......drivers, customer service staff all aggressive.....absolutely shocking and its a pity that 'secret shoppers' didnt travel on your 'services' and report their findings otherwise you might end up losing even more customers.I want compensated for this yet you are making it as hard as possible by NOT admitting responsibility. Well......this was no out of your control situation. TWO of YOUR coaches broke down in ONE journey so dont you think that your maintenance team need closely looked into to find out why so many of your coaches aren't capable of handling lengthy journeys.Oh and sort your staffs attitude out, they should be sympathetic and NOT aggressive.

I think I should be refunded I called they were close of course so left message but got no call back such poor poor service and price difference not much to national expresss but get better service. I got a respond to this asking me to call I thought they going to refund but no they put the blame on me saying I should have called them if I didn’t received my ticket not easy to call mega bus if they don’t give you the number to call us it . Like I said bad poor poor service for my return I went on mega bus I booked a seat .

I complained at customer service and the rude agent who hardly made eye contact askes me to pay for another trip which would be 2 hours later.

There were also 5 double seats left empty (10 seats in total) that no one took. I don’t see why megabus started doing that and won’t let you use the unreserved seats if no one bought them. I hate this service and I will be using national express from now on. At least they have air con, their coaches are fairly new and there is none of this empty seats nonsense. Really poor.

Long story short- megabus will NOT contact the driver OR second driver who isn’t even driving ??? while the bus is moving. They will NOT chase up that driver after the bus stops. They will NOT contact the mysterious (non existent?) lost property office at the end of the route. They will NOT even pass on ANY OTHER NUMBERS. They will NOT check their cctv on the bus to check if the bag was taken by another passenger. They will NOT contact you unless any lost property magically appears. They will NOT be understanding. They will NOT offer the SLIGHTEST BIT OF HELP to recover your property. They DO however, give their drivers the green light to help themselves to ANYTHING left on the bus. So yes!!! The drivers have every opportunity to steal lost/ left belongings because THE COMPANY DOES NOTHING TO CHECK!!!! If we had the slightest idea of the pantomime that would follow, we would have driven to London to try and check the bus ourselves. Every person we spoke to sounded like a robot reading from a script!!! End of story- no bag recovered- maybe it was taken by a passenger? High chance the drivers took it? WE WILL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE MEGABUS DON’ T GIVE A CRAP ONE WAY OR ANOTHER- AND IN THIS DAY & AGE, SUCH APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE CAN ONLY LEAD TO A BANKRUPT BUSINESS. And so it should. We had more help from other bus companies who had NO need to help us but did because they ALSO know how TRULY AWFUL megabus are!!SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.",24 October 2019
"No children allowed even if you've paid!Wish there was a 0 rating. I was boarding the 16:05 coach towards London from Newcastle-upon-Tyne (John Dobson Street) and ""reversed seats 13 and 14"" . 1. via my email, and 2. via my partners email, I have a premature baby in a car seat and the driver said I cannot board the coach with the car seat. I explained that this has never been a problem before, my partner has reversed seat 14 for my baby, and he responded ""well he will have to sit miles away from you"". The driver was very rude, unprofessional and unknowing of policy regarding kids travelling free under the age of 3 (with a paid adult ticket) . I take this journey to and from Newcastle very often. So therefore, I don't know why I was told I cannot board the coach and that I need to hold my baby. This is obnoxious behaviour for someone of a professional background. Since our journey I have been in touch with several people from customer services and the complaints department, and all I'm getting is generic emails regarding the level of high customer service from the drivers and I'm being told, yet again about the policy regarding children under 3 years of age, in which I already know about. NEVER AGAIN.",23 October 2019
"Steer clear of certain drivers!!Today I travelled from cardiff to bristol. The bus driver told me to get off of at bristol, I asked if my reserved seats were available which I had paid extra for, he just said no. When we got onto the bus we had our small hand luggage and thought why not sit at the front as I suffer badly with travel sickness, it means I can see clearly out the front and it gives us a chance to stretch our legs. A satchel bag was on one seat so I moved it onto the next seat, as it was just dumped in the middle of two chairs, to be able to get onto a seat. The driver then spoke to me like a child, looked at me like dirt and said very loudly "" you moved my suitcase, DO NOT DO THAT AGAIN,  MOVE NOW ""! He had basically reserved the two front seats for his bag. We were so baffled we moved right to the back of the bus as we didnt want to be anywhere near him, I suffer with anxiety when travelling as it is, being humiliated in front of a bus of people didnt help!!. Not only that, we wasted money on reserving seats which we never got or they were double booked!!! Absolutely ridiculous, we will NEVER travel with megabus again!!!!!",20 October 2019
"Really bad companyReally bad company. Drivers are very rude. Customer services is really bad. As a personal experience: I had bought a ticket for edinburgh-glasgow at which i tried to get on at haymarket (on the way to glasgow), and the drivers wouldn’t let me because apparently you just can hop in from the edinburgh bus station, that makes no f-ing sense. Had to buy another ticket when i arrived at the bus station. Disgrace. Poor.",15 October 2019

"AE4BIEY Bristol to London 9:30 13:15On Sunday the 13.10.2019 the Megabus bus AE4BIEY was late 1 hour so we’ve lost the other bus for the airport. At the arrival my girlfriend asked the driver, why are we so much late, and she replied, “you haven’t seen how much traffic was ? When in reality we’ve been stuck in traffic for no longer than max 10 minutes all together. All the passengers becomes unsettled when they’ve seen how much the bus was late. During the journey, the driver didn’t even let the passengers to know, at least, that we run late. When we asked for a explanation, the driver, with another two colleagues who join the chat, becomes verbally rude and trying to, push the blame on us, for loosing the second bus. The time for the bus to arrive at Victoria Coach station from Bristol, was 12:15. The Megabus bus, reach at 13:15. Very bad experience and staff members, rude , impolite and very very unprofessional. You should be ashamed of yourself.",13 October 2019
The driver charged me twice.heI missed the bus from London Gatwick for just 10m late (because my plane had 2 hours delay). I waited almost 3 hours in order to take the next bus and the driver charged me the full price again. I find it an injustice.,11 October 2019
"Shocking, do yourself a favour and choose someone elseTo date, I’ve taken a few Leeds-London returns and was ok. This weekend has been awful and will now avoid them like the plague. Holed up for ages at services to pick up drivers on the way, charging facilities not working on board and toilet with a river of urine on the floor then trampled around the bus from people’s shoes. Just foul. The ‘return’ I booked on Megabus website turned out not to be a return at all and new ticket had to be bought.  Ended up paying almost as much as the train and kicked myself why I didn’t - Megabus not worth chancing. Already spoken to Customer Services and received the stock ‘sorry we are not going to do anything’ response. Despite the reply below, what’s the point of contacting them directly when it’ll clearly give me the same fob off excuse...",07 October 2019
"£11 or £85?I pay £2.40 to go 1 mile where I live. I also get the mega bus for £11 to go 300 miles toNewcastle. I get a seat, with WiFi and charging port a long with staff who sort my luggage. I’ve had a few delays, I’ve had a few bus swaps. I’m fully aware of the risk, hence why I only pay £11. Im fully aware I can pay £87 for a train and still face delays. I can be loud on bus, sometimes I have a beer. Thus, I suspect others may too. You can’t fault mega bus one bit. If you don’t like it, pay 5 times more and get national express. Keep going MB - you’re doing just fine",01 October 2019
"Absolutely disgusting serviceAbsolutely disgusting service. Daughter, partner and 9 month old baby from fosse park Leicester to Newcastle. Driver looks half asleep. Loads luggage then they board the coach. People laying on seats blocking the aisle. The three seats they have booked are taken!!  They paid for a seat so baby could be in car seat. Before they have chance to say anything the driver pulls off. They end up in separate seats. They baby is one side of the aisle and mum the other side. Dad is a few rows back. No safety measures in place. Would never recommend this company!!!",01 October 2019

The driver took a 30 minute stop (informing us that it was to be just a 10 minute break).This is unacceptable, since people depend on arriving the time stated when booking the tickets.Some delay is acceptable due to traffic in London but not extending the travel time fro 2h45min to 5hours!!",28 September 2019

"First Time Travelling & definitely Will Use Again 😃We traveled for the first time with Megabus last Monday from Newcastle to Bristol 9am departure, we arrived at John Dobson street stop and were greeted by a welcoming driver who was very helpful putting our hold all’s in the storage for us etc. The bus was clean, comfortable with charging ports and WiFi the journey was really pleasant and the driver kept us up to date with the stops and timings, even when they changed drivers.We got to Birmingham half hour early to get our connection bus to Bristol 3pm when it arrived this bus driver was cheeky and wasn’t very helpful especially when we got off he just opened the storage and we all had to scramble and retrieve our own bags, glad no ones got stolen as he couldn’t have cared less.After 4 nights in Somerset we headed back to Bristol for our return journey 13.25 bus and were greeted by what I can say the happiest, most helpful and welcoming drivers Martin and his colleague Leon I think his name was, this time we traveled to Leeds before we got our connection service but at all the stops on the way Martin came upstairs and made sure everyone was ok. He truly is an asset to your company.Our driver from Leeds to Newcastle was very much like Martin, chatty and helpful.We both have said we would travel again with Megabus as it was a pleasant and cheap way to travel.It was less than £50 for two people return tickets from Newcastle to Bristol.",17 September 2019
"Horrible serviceHorrible service! We were trying to return from our holiday and for 3 days I was unable to purchase the megabus tickets online. The payment would not go through. Eventually, the day before our flight, I called them. They started processing the purchase and when we reached the payment stage, he was unable to open the page. I explained that we were landing on Heathrow and needed to go to Bristol, so I needed the tickets urgently. The megabus rep said there was nothing he could do. Just keep trying online and if it does not work, buy the tickets when you land. Needless to say that megabus does not have a ticket office in all terminals at Heathrow!We could not purchase the tickets before the flight. We landed, went online and got them about 1 hour before the coach was booked to arrive. After a night of travelling and being exhausted, I did not think of reading the terms and conditions while in the airport.Coach comes. The driver was very angry and aggressive right from the start. We were 2 people with 3 suitcases. 1 big and 2 small. He got so very angry because we did not read the terms and conditions and we had 3 bags! He even refused to put one of them in the luggage compartment, so we had to do it after he just threw the other 2 in there! He was raising his voice at us for not reading the terms!I explained that we had just bought the tickets as their website and phone rep were absolutely useless for days, and got on the coach, but I am never ever using this crap company again!They have no customer service, drivers are rude and they never help! I would rather pay the extra £10-20 and travel nicely with National Express!Shame on you megabus!",16 September 2019

"Worst Coach Service I have ever been…Worst Coach Service I have ever been on. The only reason they are in business is because of students and unsuspecting tourists.I have been using Megabus on a weekly basis to get to and form London to Bristol. AVIOD using Megabus at any cost. The only attractive incentive is the very cheap fares. But you will literally get what you paid for. Seats are uncomfortable and cramped and the toilets are filthy.  For a few extra pounds I will from now on use only National Express Coaches. The final straw for me was when Megabus changed the usual bus stop to a new one on the other side of a university campus. No notice was given and when complained, their customer services blamed me for not noticing the small print on my ticket. I was not the only customer in this situation and one of the other passengers then highlighted that her ticket had no specific stop mentioned at which point the customer service agent responded 'you should have looked at the website'.  Their website is next to useless and they make no effort to communicate any changes to the services. Don't expect any other support from Megabus. Also if you are unfortunate enough to call them 10 minutes before 8 pm, be warned, they will try to cut you off as their shift ends at 8pm. Needles to say that I missed the last coach and ended up paying for a train. MEGABUS is not worth the money they charge you and definitely no value given to customer care.",11 September 2019

"""Not our problem""Glasgow 9:30 to Perth and return at 16:55 on Saturday 7 September. Booked via my PC on Thursday night to Perth Bus Station (specifically, not the park-and-ride: I changed my plans to be able to book a journey to the bus station). Confirmation came through via email. Note that I am an older lady and do not own a cell phone, but do carry an older ""calls only"" phone for emergencies.On Friday afternoon I logged in to my email to find a message from Megabus saying the stop had been changed to the park-and-ride, but that our onward travel was good on the Stagecoach 7A bus to and from the city centre. Because it was within 24 hours of our departure, I could not change the reservation to another time or day (or we would have postponed our travel).The bus at Glasgow was on time. We arrived in Perth city centre at  more or less at the same time as we would have if our original schedule had been met. We conducted our business, and then went back to the bus stop (in front of the Library, as directed by Megabus) an hour and a half early to catch the shuttle back to the Park-and-Ride. The sign at the bus stop said 7A buses were supposed to run every 20 minutes (we had checked on our arrival). After waiting close to an hour, with only one 7A passing (full, did not stop) I gave my phone to my daughter and asked her to contact  Megabus to see if they could help us, as the road noise was such that I could not hear anything on the phone.When my daughter told the Megabus rep that we were afraid we would miss our connection, she replied it wasn't Megabus's problem and to phone Stagecoach. She told the Megabus rep that she did not have the Stagecoach phone number and the woman told her to ""Google it."" My daughter snapped back ""how, as she didn't have a damned smartphone?"" and the Megabus rep told her to not curse at her and hanged up on her. We were left stranded there for some time, as were several other people in the same situation at that bus stop. Several people booked taxis, who promised to return to pick others up. We were waiting for the taxi to return when a 7A did come along - and it was packed to overfull when we all got on it. I think a few people were not able to get on that bus. I stood for the entire journey to the park-and-ride, very much like a sardine in a tin.While the use of a colorful metaphor for our phone was probably not the most helpful thing my daughter could have said at the time, it was brought on by the obvious ""we don't care"" attitude of the Megabus representative. The least we would have expected was an explanation of how to use our tickets on a later bus, if we did miss connections. The best would have been some actual assistance from Megabus on using the service that they sold to us.This is not the first time we've had trouble with our return travel - but it is definitely the ~last~ time we will use Megabus. Their customer service was abysmal and they rather obviously don't care about their customers. If anyone asks for our opinion regarding the company, we will most definitely share it. They are quick to take your money and will then leave you hanging if there are any problems.REFERENCE MEGABUS RESPONSE:   I already contacted your people. That's what I've written about, above. There was a line of several people in the same situation and your person didn't give a darned. Said it wasn't her problem. Which makes it YOUR problem.",08 September 2019

Refused to open the luggage doors when boarding passengers and had to be asked by a fellow passenger to open the luggage doors for me2. Demanded to know what price I paid for my ticket when I showed him the printed copy of my reservation itinerary. Told me I must not have paid for my ticket as I didn’t know the price I paid off by heart - what stupid logic is this!?3. I then offered to show him the email confirmation and he accused me of zooming out so he couldn’t see the price. When I zoomed in on the price for him he didn’t say thank you. He said what I showed him on paper didn’t make sense. He then wrote the date on my printed confirmation - THE DATE, TIME, RESERVATION NUMBER AND ROUTE ARE ALREADY WRITTEN ON THE PRINTED CONFIRMATION!!4. He continued to make remarks about me to the passengers at the front of the bus as I boarded (“what is she doing”, “this paper doesn’t make any sense”)5. When we arrived at the airport he helped two ladies of his ethnicity with their luggage and wished them well. He stood over me and watched me take my own bag and made a remark behind my back as I was walking away.This is absolutely atrocious behaviour and this driver should not be dealing with the public. He is racist and aggressive and he ruined the beginning of a trip abroad for me.

"Con artistsCon artists. As a tourist from Canada I recently used Megabus to travel around the UK. Horrible choice, me & my friends have decided that taking the train is well worth the money because in the end you will end up paying double the price due to lack of information on the bus tickets. One of the incidents was the bus tickets told me to take the bus from Inverness to Perth & change at Perth for an Edinburgh bus. Me and my friend waited 30 minutes & no Perth bus showed up. We end up being told the bus to Glasgow was the bus we were suppose to take, even though the ticket says nothing about a Glasgow bus. So now we are stranded unless we pay for a £30 bus ticket to Edinburgh that costs me another bus ticket because ill arrive in Edinburgh too late to catch my bus to Newcastle. We have decided they use this tactic by making the tickets lack important information to confuse customers & make them pay for the expensive last minute ticket.",19 August 2019
"MegaBus lives up to its name!I needed to get from Taunton, Somerset to Leeds this week and after looking at train prices, which are just crazy and then National Express which are okay, I decided to look at MegaBus. Now after all the bad reviews on here I wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised! Firstly these are not buses really. They are decent, comfy coaches with good air con, usb charging and seatbelts on all seats. I’m sure, like any form of transportation, they have delays but we were on time at my only change in Bristol and on time at all pick-ups. This was a smooth journey and at £20 an absolute bargain. Too many on here gripe about things beyond Megabus’s control. The journey was a breeze and your drivers and helpers made it easy to find the right bus. I’ll be getting a ride back home with my wife and two kids. To be honest I think I’d rather be with you guys! A BIG WELL DONE!!!",17 August 2019
Late ServiceOk so booked tickets for the wife and kids to meet me in Exeter. They arrived at the Bristol departure point at 1630 for a 1705 departure. at 1730 I happen to drop a text to ask how journey is going  ...they are still waiting for the bus to arrive. We Give it s big longer before I phone the help line and explain that the service is now 45 mins late and advised it will be at least a further 30 minutes before it gets there. The bus stop is outside and it's raining. Obviously people are now getting more and more disheartened especially by the lack of information.  Result is my wife has now booked an Uber *£160+  on top of bus fare just to ensure they actually get here at some point. The thing that really gauls me is the company do not even have the balls to justify the abundance of poor reviews on this site by giving an answer to peoples comments and just leave a generic computer punted out spiel of we are sorry please contact us at.....well I did contact you and your service is something I cant leave here. Once bitten twice shy I shall never use it reccomend your company as long as I draw breath.,16 August 2019

I had £70 credit left didn’t understand the instructions I thought you can book one trip then book more but whoops my £70 disappears. Called customer service after the last putting me on hold for almost 10minutes only to come back and say there is nothing he can do even the managers can not offer my credit back. This is how they embezzled people because they know people will fall into situations like this and they will get more money. I am so disappointed that u can’t even get a refund 14days to your trip.

I immediately called customer service I was told to book another ticket, no one even tried to see how they can put me on another bus going to my destination, I was just stranded. Very wicked and unfair",05 August 2019
I travel alot with mega bus and…I travel alot with mega bus and national express and have never left a review bit I've actually had enough of getting on the coach and either frezzing to death or roasting alive!I don't usually travel by coach with my 2 year old bit did today from on the M10 13.10 from Cardiff to London 05/08/19 and it's so hot she has just been sick everywhere!!It's ridiculous to not have some sort of system in place where the driver can adjust the temperature to a civilized temperature as everyone is so hot they are gasping for air!!!!,05 August 2019
"Minimum 20 mins late maximum 2hrs lateMinimum 20 mins late maximum 2hrs late, averages a late time of 40mins",03 August 2019
Worst Customer service everI got in contact with the customer service saying that we will have a baby with us and that I am worried that she will get a gold if they have the air conditioning in full. They have just replied that they can not refund my ticket.Worst Customer service ever. I regret buying my tickets from them. They don't care about their customers.,03 August 2019
"Absolutely terrible serviceAbsolutely terrible service. Firstly the outbound bus going out was nearly an hour late and then on the return journey the toilet was broken.When booking the tickets I have been charged for 2 outbound journeys rather than an outbound and a return, so had to purchase another return! Megabus are insisting that this is my fault although I am 100% I completed the booking correctly, their customer service have spoken to me like I am stupid and refused to refund my ticket that was bought due to an issue with their website!Definitely would not recommend that anybody uses Megabus and I will be using a different company in the future!",01 August 2019
"smellsToilet door open and absolutely stunk all the way from Cardiff to London, moved 3 times and could still smell if, the lock was broken on the door so we couldn’t lock it to keep the stench in",31 July 2019
"Mega bus mega insect bitesTraveled on the mega bus from Manchester to Middlesbrough last Wednesday evening.Journey  ok as expected,  however don't wear shorts.  I was bitten all over my legs with at least a dozen bites. A week later the worst is still 3 inches in diameter and raised.Good journey but bus clearly infested with something.",31 July 2019
"Zero for Customer ServiceToday I was due to travel on the 1210 Megabus from Glasgow to Inverness which was my return journey. I left Greenock on a 1025 bus service that was due to arrive at Glasgow Buchanan Station around 1120. Due to a car accident on the M8 the bus I was travelling in was delayed 50 minutes and I arrived to a chaotic Buchanan Station full of buses arriving following long delays. My bus pulled into stance 50 at exactly 1210 and I was so relieved to see my 1210 Megabus still sitting in the stance and I ran straight from stance 50 to stance 53 to collect it. The doors were closed and despite waving and pleading with the driver he refused to open the door to let me on and proceeded to sit there for a further minute before moving off. I will never forget the dismissive gesture of that man with zero empathy for the situation.I spoke to a member of staff at the bus station who told me my only option was to wait for the next bus but that even if there was space it would be driver discretion as to whether I would be allowed to travel.I phoned Megabus to see if I could get any solid assurance but was told that the 1310 was full but there were seats available on the 1410 service but again was told that it was up to the driver whether he would allow me to travel and the only way to assure travel would be to purchase another ticket.I went to the service desk at the station where I tried to explain the situation re the delay due to an RTA on the motorway and asked if they could please allow me to transfer my ticket to the next available bus, especially as I had been refused entry to the bus I had a paid ticket for. I was simply told ""you were late, you need to buy a new ticket"". I was told there was availability on the 1410 and it would be cheaper to buy online so I went off to do that.When I went online, the earliest available was 1520 so I went back to the desk to check again and was told the cheap Internet tickets must be gone but there was availability at 1410 and they could give me a ticket for £35, 45% more than I had paid for the return ticket!Bus station staff were well aware of the incident on the motorway and I can only conclude that their refusal to allow me on the bus that was there and their refusal to transfer my ticket was them turning an awful situation to their own advantage by making more money forcing delayed passengers to pay handsomely in order to complete their journeys.Given the poor service I had already received I decided to walk around the corner and got a train ticket home.Clearly the cheap prices Megabus offer reflects the lack of care and focus that the brand have for the customer and therefore I think in future it's worth just paying the marginally higher price to travel by other means.",29 July 2019
First time userFirst time user: website allowed me to book my return ticket within my initial trip. No warnings and no refund.,28 July 2019

"Delays, No Updates,Was supposed to be in Leeds at 01.00am but it's 02.58 now and we are stuck I don't know where, the bus is dead, aircon is off, it's soo hot in the bus, driver just told us bus can't go further and that was it, no updates. I really appreciate this company but for you to go on top, you really need to make the customer happy all the time, and make sure your fleet is well serviced.Thank you",20 July 2019
"We boarded and the driver came on,and…We boarded and the driver came on,and drove -  no introduction, info or speech about journey, emergency, facilities on board, etc. Nothing! Aircon was freezing, I needed toilets but wasnt sure if bus would stop on motorway or if there were loos on board (dont think there were)!",19 July 2019
The absolutely disgusting business…The absolutely disgusting business practice of not sending confirmation emails until directly asked by phone just in time for travel and then when they do come them being disjointed enough and inaccurate and confusing enough for the driver to deny it is a valid ticket. One might think that must pay their drivers such crap wages that they have to scam the public in order to make a living. I will be making it my mission to make sure that none of my friends or family ever use this company or Falcon again.,18 July 2019
"awful experienceawful experience. booked my ticket for £1 discount with my accord card, which expired in January 2023, got on and my accord card was ‘expired’, even though I used it last week on a bus and it worked perfectly, clearly a fault with the machine. will not be recommending this to anyone. had to pay £33 so an extra £32 than I was supposed to. spent all my money I had for the trip. safe to say I am dreading my bus journey home.",13 July 2019
"No normal air conditionerNow  i am heading  from London to Bristol (17.00  11/7/2019)sitting on the top floor. It is unbearable very hot. Unfortunstely we can't reach a driver to ask turn on  conditioner stronger as here is not stairs down. The top have separate entrance.  Also, the floor is hot!  Is it the heating on?  +25 outside! Ah, hope  I will survive this journey but  never ever again with Megabus in the summer time! Unfortunately, bus driver was negative and rude too. So one star. P.S.Thanks Trustpilot! I have a response from Megabus. Next time I will contact them if any problems accure.So I put stars bit more now. Thanks",11 July 2019
"never againHaving used megabus (experimentally) once before my wife and I decided to brave it one more time on the assumption lighting - surely - doesn't strike twice. How wrong we were.The same experiences were thus: the M11 service bus arrived in Glasgow in time but with no organized boarding structure it, after an hour early arrival to secure a good seat, was a free for all. We lost our chance at claiming a decent seat but nevertheless thanked the stars we got a seat.A 10 hour journey ahead of us we settled in and before long decided to snack. Before reaching Preston, a few hours in, the need for (everyone) to visit the ‘wee’ room began. But oh no..to everyone’s chagrin the toilet we were told, (by downstairs passengers, not the driver mind you) was ‘out of order’. Not to worry, t least we’ll get a stop soon enough.Not a chance! At Preston we were aggressively told by the driver (who was changing shifts with a second driver) it was a pick up stop only and anyone not back on the bus in minutes, would “get left behind”. Quote.The driver announced that if the toilet was broken, we’d stop at a service station in Lancaster. Alas, apparently only the door was jammed and voila! We were to keep going onto Manchester.Anyone on board who would imagine that there’d be NO stops for a break, a coffee, a cigarette (despite how ridiculous that is) or A TOILET! clearly does not belong on a coach journey, anywhere, ever. That’s absurd.But we did not stop. And yes you’ve guessed it the stench from the bog that is the megabus ‘toilette’ turned into the sewer from hell. Hades could not be any worse!I questioned myself the entire journey, not on why had i chosen megabus (again!) but on deeper, more profound logic, why was I here, what had I done in a past life, who am I, what’s my purpose? Moreover what the hell? We’re being bullied by a bus driver who refuses to stop for dozens of paying customers to relieve themselves of the most basic of human functions?! Whilst our direct neighbouring passenger was a surgeon on his way to Great Yarmouth st in London to interview for a position, and being as accommodating as possible dealing with the rancid choke hold the toilet had over us all. But oh no, the driver is God. He even locked us all on the bus in Birmingham whist he went to take a break (one might even assume a pee?) to ensure NO one escaped.What’s going on here Megabus?This, the second same experience. Never again. Unless you can alter the way you run buses when toilets are out of action and provide a replacement bus, have at least a break on a long journey for passengers to refresh or eat, or provide compensation for inconveniences like aforementioned..holding my breath megabus (you have my email) then no thanks.",08 July 2019
"My wife and 2 friends were going to…My wife and 2 friends were going to London, coach broke down which was unfortunate and they were stranded near Silverstone after being on for 5 hours, had to get a taxi into London. Did expect to have trouble getting the £130 taxi fare back but they have been outstanding and sent out a cheque 6 days after the trip. Cant give 5 stars due to the coach but from a customer service point of view defo 5 stars and would use them again, the return trip was brilliant for waht you pay.",08 July 2019
Over bookedOver booked. Drive said we can get a call for refund and a free trip but just a refund no free trip. Got a train instead which cost a lot to buy on the day. Wasted my time and money.,06 July 2019
