"Worst transport in IrelandThis  service is a great example of anything made or built by the Irish. Doesn’t work properly, always late, zero information on why these things happen also and completely ignorant of these problems acting as if they never happen. I get the  5 times a week. I get this  anywhere from 9am-5pm to Dublin and anywhere from 5pm-3:30am. Out of the 5 times a week two  rides the  is late 80-90% of the time. The rest of the 10% it doesn’t show up with zero explanation. It’s actually extremely rare that these  services run smoothly I’ve been taking a   service for 3 years every week consistently and never has it been good. I feel sorry for the drivers as they aren’t all bad bar a few. But they have to deal with a poo transport system, poo vehicles, and a poo government that will not update anything but their own pockets. No one but customers will read this. But if someone reads this that has any title to fix these issue how about you get up off your ass and fix something that could be done in a couple of weeks rather than lining your own pockets with the money of poorer less fortunate people.",2024-01-03
"Has to be the worst transport service…Has to be the worst transport service ever! running an hour late.And then after exiting Dublin Airport, which is extremely busy.The driver decides to go for another spin into the airport adding another 30mins at least to the journey.  is a joke of a business.Is it that they want to run this service into the ground, to give reason for a private company to take over?",2023-12-29
"The most unreliable serviceNo only are we unsure if the  will arrive, if it does arrive it's always late and now   are telling drivers to drive by people waiting if the  is late. Not to mention the buses don't go the full intended route as well as some drivers being unnecessarily mean.",2023-12-11

Cant even get a student ticket in peaceJust drove a 6 oclock  to westport from castlebar i had to take for work i am 16 so usually i take student ticket and when i was 15 child tickets but when i started working i had to go often which meant i had to get student tickets and   is the only  that drives to westport. I got this  all the time from the same  drivers and the more often i started going the ruder they got. I know the  drivers and never got told to bring a student ID until the last few times. 1 of the times the  driver was extremely rude when i bought an online ticket coming back to castlebar he started telling me i am not this age and i need to bring ID and was about to make me wait until the next  then he proceeds to  the ticket into his  and it didnt work. Took a few attempts until he told me that people tend to cancel these tickets like i was trying to scam my way through. I finally got on then today. Something like that happened in the morning before where the  driver was aggressively telling me that i am not a student when ive drove with him so many multiple times before. This morning same thing happened when i got eye rolls even though i accepted the fact straight away that i dont have a student ID on me. He spoke to me like i was some pet like i argued with him for 30 mins about it which i didnt i usually thank the  drivers too he then tried to trick me into buying a single adult ticket when i told him that i need a return ticket like im some cheapscate that doesnt have any money and assumed it sobus  fix up your drivers attitude if i respected them the many times i have driven the buses they should respect me too and yes they wrre playing by the rules but in a very rude unnecessary way,2023-12-27
"Dear God...Dear God, this company is undisputed, absolutely peerless in soul crushingly terrible, utterly indifferent hopelessly incompetent ""service"". This 245 route to Cork is once every hour and they routinely just don't even bother showing up. Waiting 2 HOURS for a  is just plainly mind numbing. I looong for the day I get my car and no longer need this despair in my life. The government really needs to remove their commission for public transport in this country.

"High fares for unreliable services101  Service from Dublin to Drogheda has started using smaller capacity single decker  which if you are taking at peak times will be always full unless you are taking it from the  station. The seats are uncomfortable. One of the Fridays, it was raining and I was waiting to take the 101, first of all the app is never correct on timings, the  came 5 mins later than the time shown on the app. It didn't even stop in swords and drove past the  stop. The next  came after 30 mins, which was already full. I managed to get an aisle seat but there is literally no room. I usually keep my bag on the lap, but there was no room to keep it there. It kept falling and the girl beside me was also uncomfortable. Don't understand why they have huge luggage racks up in the front when most commuters like me are daily work/school/college commuters. Literally no one I know uses 101 to go to the airport if they are flying somewhere. Now the 100x is whole another story. Although you can reach city/airport quite quickly if you manage to get on it at peak times, they only have  hourly service with ridiculous fares. 10.50 one way from Drogheda to Dublin Airport, for less than a 25 min ride! You can fly somewhere in Europe for much cheaper for the same amount you spend on Expressway buses. Public transports should be affordable!",2023-11-17
"Just went on the 115  from dublin to…Just went on the 115  from dublin to mullingar from heuston at 18:50  and was welcomed to the  driver having his legs spread at the chair… that’s not all, i was going to maynooth university but had a change a plans and had to get groceries before i went to the uni and tried to leave at the stop beside the train station only to be screamed at and told to sit down and he said if he ever sees me again that he would refuse service to me… atrocious language and behaviour for wanting to get off an earlier stop…. Not only this  has consistently cancelled and delayed buses they also have extremely rude  drivers. I take this  weekly and has never been a problem if i wanted to leave earlier or not. Terrible  company and if there was another faster  i would take that any other day over this terrible ass .",2023-12-04
"  drivers are heartless and recklessBus  drivers are the most wicked human beings on the surface of the earth and on any other planet that has human beings. The buses are so irregular, either they are coming too early or too late. When they are early, they don’t wait for the set time they are supposed to be at any  stop and when you see them just pulling out and you are running and waving them down, they pull out and drive past you in the cold and rain. How heartless can a human being be? This is a constant occurrence on the 101X from Dublin to Drogheda especially at the close of work between 4.30pm and 5.30pm. They rather drive away with an empty  than wait a minute or 2 for the real time to get enough passengers, this is the most cruel behaviour I have seen in my entire life. They don’t deserve any star at all.",2023-11-27

"Oleg Rakuts 109AI want to say a big thank you to one of your driver's Oleg Rakuts on the 109A route. He rang me on Saturday morning to say he found my son's phone. He asked me where we live and when I told him we live in Ratoath he suggested instead of us driving to the depot in Kells, he told us what time he'll be traveling through Ratoath that night on the 109A route so my son was able to meet him at the  stop where he handed the phone back to him safe and sound. What a kind, honest and very helpful member of staff you have. The 109A route is an excellent service and Oleg is a credit to you. Could you forward this message to his manager please?

They often don’t keep to the timetable and can show up either too early or too late and if they show up late it can be over 30 minutes late!! It’s like they regularly show up whenever they want to. Also, there’s no timetables on either of the  stops I use and no real time info either, so it’s a guess work! Yesterday I was waiting over 20 minutes for the 216 and today over 30 minutes for the 219 in the cold. An appalling and unreliable service. The Irish government should drastically improve the public transport!!",2023-11-15
Ever since they added more stops to the…Ever since they added more stops to the 323 route that never did few years back. It means lot more passages now get 323 and using these new buses are a joke there's less seats now than the old buses. So now there always full most days so some passengers are left behind and have to wait for the next one.   seriously have to re think 323 route because under current format using those new buses it's not working and also 3 hour gap in morns and afternoons that there's no service adds to the problem because it adds to the volume of passengers then on next  after those 3 hours. Where as if we had extra buses in those 3 hours it could help with the amount of passengers then over following services.,2023-10-09
Absolutely terribleAbsolutely terrible. The 343 is the most unreliable chaotic absolutely ridiculous. I can't tell you how many times it literally just did not show up ..Leaving an hour wait which is just not good enough as it is a busy route with many people relying on it to get to work/school etc..If it does manage to show up it is usually late and could have an hour and half journey ahead of you that should be only a half hour cramped next to strangers. Unfortunately I don't drive and so I have to continue to suffer these poor conditions as I have no other choice financially. At 5 months pregnant though I am finding it increasingly difficult to tolerate.,2023-10-11

101 morning service has become frustrating and unreliableI was at the Balbriggan Garda Station  stop this morning at 6.40am waiting for the 101 service to show up. It didn’t arrive until almost 7.30am and it was so full that it left most passengers stranded. Single decker buses with only about two thirds the capacity of the old coaches are being deployed during peak hours on the 101 service also. These buses don’t have the capacity to take on all the passengers along the route causing people to be regularly stranded. It’s just not good enough.,2023-10-18

You can't rely on the Cork City or county services for anything important, the buses are early, late or just don't show up. The whole thing just needs reforming, it's definitely the worst public transport service I've encountered except for North America where it's non existent. They probably need to travel a bit and get inspired by some other European countries.",2023-08-23
"This is a nightmareBuses are always cancelled. To arrive at the point you should wait approx. 30 minutes. Often it's under the rain. Sometimes drivers just ignores the fact that you are standing on the  stop and drive away!!! It’s very illogical that to go from the center to Ardkeen you can’t take route 354 because it’s a pickup only at this stop!!! Everything has been done to make the buses as inconvenient as possible for users!!! TFI route app is not always correct and you can only lean on the fate and luck to arrive home not after 2 hours after work day tired, exhausted and wet from the rain.People uses this company only because it's monopolist.

"Public service not suitable for Ireland's second city.Let me preface this by saying that my judgement is limited to Cork city, relative to several episodes experienced first-hand. I also stress that I have a fair amount of experience in using public transport in other nations.The public transport service seems to me to be not up to the standard of what is considered Ireland's second city, because:- too few journeys; they should increase the frequency of journeys. Just to give some examples seen in the first weeks of stay in Cork (but who knows what else there is), there are lines (e.g. the 245) that regularly have a queue to get on the  from Cork station! I have waited standing several times for a quarter of an hour or half an hour.... There are lines (such as the 210) that run every 90 minutes (I am talking about the city centre…). Furthermore, it has already happened to me that the full  did not stop!- too many delays: there is no point in indicating a timetable when there are so many delays that one no longer looks at the tables and relies on fate;- there are electronic realtime signs in the city centre, but these are exceptions (perhaps they are mainly urban decorations);- the indications for  stops are non-existent, incomprehensible or useless. I would like to be able to orient myself in the lines just by looking at the boards posted on the shelters, without Google Maps or another navigator (as, for example, is possible in London);- it is not a public service that can be considered for going to work or other important appointments: I have had to cancel appointments because of this. I strongly advise against relying on it, or take it well in advance always ready to call a taxi if it gets bad. It is only suitable for elderly people, students, and those who for other reasons do not have a car, that’s all;- slow service at the stops (time wasting and boring): in fact, first of all there is only one  door where you get on and off, so you have to wait every time before getting on until the last person has gotten off! Waiting for passengers to get off may be justifiable in the metro, not in the !Once on board, every time you get on a , you have to turn to the driver to tell him where you want to go, or at least to put the card in front of him. Basically the driver also acts as the ticket taker.- there are no rules for luggage, it depends on the mood of the driver maybe or who knows what (I haven't quite figured it out yet). If you want to carry heavy luggage, you have to hope that the driver wants to open the lower compartment door, otherwise you'll have to carry heavy suitcases into the cabin (I'm talking about the same lines with buses that have lower luggage racks).- traveling by  in Cork, despite the general low quality of the service offered, is expensive;On the POSITIVE side:- the buses I've seen so far were all clean and modern;- the drivers in general are courteous and professional, although it is normal to occasionally find rude ones (as almost everywhere);- customer service works, they answered me several times, but I think they can do up to a certain point. I would like it to be clear that I am not criticizing management: I am not capable of carrying out these analyses. I limit myself to indicating the facts experienced firsthand in the most objective way possible and without other reasons other than to see him improve one day, if possible.I reiterate that a city like Cork should strengthen and improve its public service because it is not adequate for Ireland's second city.

"Dangerous DrivingBus driver pulled right out in front of me from a secondary road, while I was on a main road. Ran me into the footpath on the opposite side. It was quite reckless of him. Had that been all he done, I could have gotten over that, as we're all human and do make mistakes. However, he then made a rude hand gesture at me, which was totally inexcusable. I emailed my experience to  , however they have not responded. I will now be escalating my complaint with the Garda as luckily I have footage of the entire event.

My biggest complaint is the rudeness of the drivers. The first man was just miserable and gruff, but the driver that drove the return  was something else completely.  It was like being transported back to my schooldays with my ticket validity being questioned very rudely (there was nothing wrong with my ticket, he just hadn’t read it properly) and a well rounded dollop of snarkiness as I went to my seat. Just a thoroughly unpleasant, nasty man who is not suited to working with people.  At all.  The girl that I was sat next to had similar stories of rude  drivers and horrible journeys which matched all the tales that my children have brought home over the years and it makes me wonder how  Éireann run their recruitment schemes?  Buses often can’t help being late/ breaking down/ getting full etc, but can’t  Éireann at least employ drivers that can cope with the everyday annoyances of people and traffic whilst being professional, showing respect and compassion?

They regularly don't show up.1 in every 2 times I get the  with her we are left disappointed. Buses are 15 minutes late, early and the driver leaves early, or they never show up.God forbid people would have to be somewhere on time.I'm writing this after we waited an hour in the centre of cork city for the required  to arrive. After a half an hour, we thought we were in luck ; the right  arrived only for the driver to switch off the engine, grab his things and leave. I asked was another driver on the way and he didn't know but said there should be.No one arrived. Oh and as he was leaving, he tried to close the doors with a button but that was broken of course. so he fumbled them 90% closed manually.For the following 20 minutes I played a game which involved spotting 'out of service ' buses driving past.There were 5 or 6 in that period, all seemingly driving around redundantly and of course emitting plenty of carbon, while a group of about 20 of us waited desperately for a .I presume that some of that group were by now late for something important.Eventually, a rogue  arrived, not on time or anything, just at random o clock, and we all rejoiced in relief.It must be amongst the worst public transport set ups in Europe. An absolute shambles and a regular let down.The complaints system is redundant too, a bit like AnPost, mired in 'ticket system ' delays and glitchy UIs.They either don't give a feck or the system allows them to ignore /bury their heads in the sand.Failed state indeed.

I have been to many countries second world and third world and this one takes the cake for worst service, most unpunctual and least pleasant. Everything about how this company handles itself is troubling and it's very regretful that we have to deal with these buses in Ireland. I really hope everyone lowers their expectations down even lower than low because there is nothing good waiting for you when using this public transportation. Just terrible all around, honestly. The amount of bad experiences I've had in just the last few months that are completely because of the  driver and the company's rules alone. This company should be banned and fined heavily. Just today I was running to the  with everything I had otherwise I will miss my college and I see it just leaving the  stop at Ventry Drive. It stops at the stop sign after driving a whole 6m at most because this road is tiny and I'm there knocking on the door for him to open it. The  driver looks straight at me and shakes his head like I'm asking for a lot here. Just open the door I've after been running to get in this  for 7 mins straight and I'm no runner. Absolutely ridiculous day missed I hate everything about this company. There is one  driver who is also extremely antisocial and I've witnessed his antisocial habits a lot over the year as he drives the 40E sometimes. He consistently starts driving the moment you drop the money in to pay for tickets. You literally don't have the ticket yet and he's driving and you're falling all over the place.

"Just avoid stress and walk.I can't tell you how many times I have been frustrated and annoyed with  . Too many to count. If I could avoid having to use them I would.The main problem is unreliability.Even with electronic notice boards at some stops you can't always be sure if a  is due. Sometimes a  simply fails to arrive and you have to wait another half hour or so for the next one. No explanation for why it was cancelled. Sometimes a driver will decide he wants to finish his shift early and will leave before time. If traffic is bad then all bets are off.Another recurring problem is drivers who seem to want to drive buses but don't like having to pick up or drop off passengers. I just had an argument with a driver who failed to stop at a  stop and accused me of not ringing the bell in time. Yet both myself and an elderly lady both pressed the button well before the stop. He was driving so fast he barely noticed our attempts to get him to stop. No apologies. Nothing.  want passengers to be courteous and respectful to their drivers. Well sorry, it cuts both ways.Also there seems to be no agreed time for how long a  should wait at a stop. Sometimes a driver will barely stop long enough to let you on. At other times you can be waiting twenty minutes for him to leave while he catches up on paperwork or something.The whole system of local city buses is badly designed and run. It is not fit for purpose. We need more trams and light rail networks in our towns and cities, otherwise people will just continue to drive cars, making  travel even worse.Even if it's only one bad experience a week it is enough to put you off for good.

"Driver on his break an excuse for leaving lateLike many people who review  Éireann through this forum, I am not satisfied. I do often wonder how you manage to keep the staff you have and recruit new staff. No wonder there have been driver shortage issues in recents weeks and months in Waterford City.On my most recent journey, the route 40  was 14 minutes late leaving Waterford  Station due to the driver being on his break at that time. This shouldn’t happen and if it does the timetables should be changed to accommodate same, or else change the driver rosters. Luckily he told us that it was his break time, most of the time they leave the  full of passengers waiting with zero explanation of why we are not leaving on time when everyone has boarded, as was the case last week.To future readers of this and current/future passengers of  Éireann, I would recommend using an alternative company such as Dublin Coach where possible as their buses are more comfortable, cleaner, MORE RELIABLE, and the drivers are rarely rude and are able to successfully communicate with people.",2021-07-10

If I had an alternative choice I’d take it but I don’t so I’m forced to use their ridiculously terrible services.Buses are notoriously late, it’s just normal at this stage, too often they don’t show up at all - no warning, no heads up - just simply no .Buses are repeatedly full during peak times.

If you don’t get on, tough luck, wait another hour, or two to get the next  home.

No way they couldn't see me waiting as I was the only person there (it was 2.45am). So I was left alone in the middle of the night, with my bags, without any idea how to make it on time to the airport. I had no other option but drive my faulty car which barely made the trip. Not only I was forced to pay for car park but I will also have to pay someone to get my ride out of there as its completely undriveable now. I wrote a complaint which has not been answered, only got an automatic email ""how did we do?"" asking how my complaint was handled (?!)

The price.5.  No pets even when in a carrier, so forget about owning a pet if you don't drive and don't want to pay 11 euro to a taxi for a 10 min drive cos there's no Uber.6 Finally, the fact that all of the above is completely dependent on the driver, some will enforce one thing and not another.  A good example, I only learnt today that you can't bring your pet in a carrier to the vet on   despite the fact I've been doing it for years.

"103 and 109a awful service.The only reason I'm writing this is because I've had no luck with  's customer service replying to my emails. My experience is solely with the 103 and 109a  routes. Both buses are seldom  less than 10 minutes late (I've never actually had either one of these buses show up on time). Often the 103  into Dublin will not show up and you'll be left waiting for upwards of half an hour and then two buses in row will drive by which I cannot fathom since neither of the buses are even close to full most of the time. Getting the 103 from town out to Ashbourne I've been left waiting for up to two hours on occasions with the  drivers driving into town not having any clue when the next  is, granted they're only covering their own journey so it's obviously not fair to hold them in anyways responsible but it would be appreciated if they're was a bit more communications between drivers or drivers and HQ so that passengers could be told when the next  is.  The 109a is even more shocking I used to rely on this  to get into college and it would often just not show up leaving you waiting for another hour for the next  to show up. The 109a is meant to be an airport  so I'm actually very surprised by the lack of service and reliability given to customers.I've actually never given a 1 star review for anything in my life and I always try to find some sort of redeeming quality in something but sadly I cannot say that about these two services.",2019-12-07
"Not reliable one bitNot reliable one bit,why do use have timetables on both apps and online but buses never come any where close to these times,if a  does come it’s usually full,you’s no the busy times from swords to drogheda are 6pm onward why not run extra buses at these times.i stood in the cold for an hour and 20 minutes twice this week because buses either didn’t show up or were full..use really don’t have a clue how to run a  service...Matthews coaches all the way",2019-12-01
" .... ..... Where do I start? Always never on time, poor time management. Staff don't even know how to drive properly. Always harsh braking. Need to practice driving before being allowed to drive a  as if you press the ""STOP"" button, I think it means ""STOP"" not drive past the  stop and stop in middle of the junction.Vehicles never clean, vomit and urine upstairs on the Double Deckers. Like Matthews.ie, Halpenny Travel, GoBus and GoAHead Ireland is doing a better job than you and they've only started expanding within the past few years or recently. ..... you let us down.",2019-09-30
"Not sure how can be defined as…Not sure how can be defined as service?! Busses are aften late, at time cancelled without any notice, tgey are dirty, overpriced. Completely inadequate to serve humans,",2019-09-24
Worst customer serviceWorst customer service. Never respond to any e mail queries.  If you phone them they are extremely rude.,2019-08-28
"Absolutely awful service!!Absolutely awful service!!What finally pushed me to write a review of this company was due to my  being cancelled, no notice, because the 'driver couldn't make it'....I'm sorry but that's no excuse! I had my daughter with me, the next  was 2 hours time, so I had to pay for food & drinks which I would not have needed had the  been on time, I emailed because I wanted a refund, I felt it was the least  Eirreann could do for the huge inconvenience. They emailed back, basically that things are bound to go wrong from time to time, it's out of their control, and refused the refund.If you happen to sitting by the window and its raining, chances are you get leaked on if it's packed you can't move seats, their buses are so old, in serious need of updating. No much legroom, often dirty, sometimes rude driver,and ny  has broken down twice in a month!!But even worse than all that, the ""customer Care"", and I use that term loosely, never, ever want to know, when I've complained, I always get the basic standard reply.....very obvious they don't care, at all!There are much better buses out there for maybe €2 more , in my opinion, I'd rather pay the extra! The  I have now switched to is light, airy, clean, leg room,sockets for phones, and DO NOT LEAK!! Plus as its an express  it gets in way ahead of  Eirreann.My daughter and I used to catch it 4 times a week, they've lost out....But clearly, keeping customers happy is not top of their agenda, never has been, never will be, as long as they can pack passengers in like sardines, that's all the care about!!I absolutely would not recommend  Eirreann!!",2019-07-17
