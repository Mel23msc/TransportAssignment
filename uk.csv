's unwillingness address legitimate concerns provide transparency left seeking redress channels. Review: My customer experience horrendous I feel compelled share benefit future customers.

My relatives (who visiting going airport) I arrived Lane 1 Leeds station well ahead schedule, least 15 minutes planned departure time 14:10. We observed approximately 20 passengers board time. However, dismay, depart scheduled. The operators claimed already departed somewhere else already halfway journey. The operators told customers coming back pick Leeds. The situation became dire realized risk missing flight. Left option, compelled arrange taxi, incurring substantial expense would entirely avoidable operated promised. It's important note decision take taxi guided information provided us coordinators scene, suggested take taxi later claim reimbursement expense. To support case, I provided compelling evidence form photographic timestamps. These photographs clearly depicted passengers waiting next engaging coordinators. This evidence directly contradicted statements made 's private operator, Prospect Coaches, subsequent emails, maintained service departed time. The photographic evidence irrefutably demonstrated remained stationed Stand 1 well scheduled departure time, calling question accuracy 's claims. Adding frustration, ticket journey clearly indicated service operated , mention Prospect Coaches. This raises serious concerns transparency reliability information provided passengers staff. One would expect accuracy dependability dealing popular service provider, yet experience demonstrated significant shortfall regard. I imagine lack communication Prospect Coaches lead situation. When contacted, Prospect Coaches answer. Regrettably, lack transparency persisted interactions 's customer service. Their responses failed address legitimate concerns also appeared deflect responsibility accountability. consistently avoided providing concrete evidence, including specific details vehicle identification number, driver details, available tracking information adhered GDPR anonymization processes. This refusal provide clear answers heightened frustration raised suspicions validity claims. Despite multiple attempts seek resolution accountability, repeatedly failed provide requested information transparent responses. This left choice pursue action Users UK. In conclusion, experience journey marred lack transparency, contradictory information, refusal address legitimate concerns. It hope future customers make informed decisions choosing travel options aware potential pitfalls may encounter dealing .",2023-04-16

"I pre-booked 15:50 Birmingham London Victoria I pre-booked 15:50 Birmingham London 25/7/23. It scheduled arrive London Victoria coach station 19:35. With mind I pre-booked train Victoria train station Ashford International 20:25. When I arrived journey Birmingham awaiting transfer connection passengers Preston. The driver assured would still make good time. Eventually delay 45 minutes set London 16:35. As journey progressed driver apologised passengers & gave yet another re-assurance would make lost time many customers complained late & like pre-booked train timetables & connections schedules. As crawled motorway signs showed 30 minute delays ahead & speed restricted 40 mph. Eventually left motorway & headed A roads Reading cars snailing along & driver position take single lane & many occasions held ransom cars driving along 20 mph 30 mph single lane zones & praying turn earliest opportunity driver could put foot & least drive 30 mph speed limit. At point became obvious going scheduled times advertised & driver confirmed unfortunate news PA received new ETA's central control & announced would Reading Station 7pm. Heathrow Airport 8pm & London Victoria 9pm. It actually turned Reading 7:09 pm. Heathrow 8:16 pm. London Victoria. 9:12 pm. As driver said apologetically disgruntled passengers PA time - "" Please shoot messenger take ."" Sitting crawled towards central London heart sank clock displayed 20:25 & pre-booked train literally left station. The inevitable delay start journey meant I stressed & anxious get go & cost pre-booked train fare Ashford well meant I pay another train. NB** I blame driver fiasco absolutely control whatsoever either initial delay Preston 40 mph speed restrictions Motorway 30 mph speed restrictions quaint roads Oxford, Reading & London, though I hold responsible strongly suggesting would make lost time beginning journey & first 25 miles crawling clearly position so. The initial solution problem I would strongly suggest give realistic timetables arrival & departure customers work to. To say very, frustrating trip London would complete understatement. On positive note however, I say driver return journey absolutely fabulous & I thanked great driving skill & stamina prompt & schedule stated designated departure & arrival times London, stopping Heathrow, Reading & Birmingham & also allowed 10 minute stop toilet break & diesel refuelling Warwick services meant actually 15 minutes late final destination Brunel St, Birmingham. Additionally first time I've bad experience & given really fantastic prices offer great reluctance I'm complaining here.

"Extremely Dissatisfied Service Extremely Dissatisfied Baggage Policy Review: I recently incredibly disappointing experience service 5th June 2023 I travelling Newport Heathrow Airport, primarily due unfair baggage policy. As frequent traveller, I rely efficient cost-effective transportation options, failed meet expectations regard. Before trip, I thoroughly reviewed 's baggage policy, clearly stated carrying extra luggage would incur fee 10. However, utter disbelief, I boarded , driver insisted I book additional ticket bring extra bag me. Essentially, I asked pay extra seat accommodate additional luggage. Being single individual, demand driver absurd completely unacceptable. It felt like unjust deceptive way extract money passengers simply trying transport belongings. Not inconvenience me, also highlighted significant flaw 's understanding implementation policies. The lack consistency officially stated policy driver's demands highly frustrating. ensure staff members well-informed trained handle situations without causing unnecessary inconvenience financial burden passengers. As result experience, I left sense deep dissatisfaction think twice choosing future travels. Any transportation company must clear fair policies place, well well-trained staff provide accurate information uphold policies consistently. I hope takes customer feedback seriously rectifies issues promptly provide reliable customer-centric service future. Rating: 1 5 stars.",2023-06-05

Not gonna mention 75 people using board toilet, dont care make 5 min break 10hrs ride, smell simply disgusting. I probably expect much bare minimum travelling anyone else.

Should advised Birmingham rep online chat asap website prearrange suitable onward travel prior arriving Glasgow. Given vouchers value missed journey today friendly, respectful, apologetic phone advisor. I would absolutely recommend choosing alternative possible - extra cost worth it. auto-bot standard reply I definitely fully deterred ever travelling again.

The seats could better head support seats say reserved, hard know sit pay reserve specific seat. The toilets time plenty loo roll soap, clean ish - cleaner train toilets recent trips. However, stairs toilet quite tight steep, making quite hard get toilet. seem timely National Express, I think I'd use I going somewhere I afford late. The coach tracking accurate, I rushed get stop multiple times, tracker saying service time, get wait 20 mins coach. The power outlets worked time without issue, fans seats, making easy make cooler wish. The temperature coaches comfortable, compared National Express freezing. I quite like loo level seating, bit awkward National Express, load people sat right outside toilet 1cm thick sliding door preserve dignity! On , toilet bit cramped though I'm short bloke. Also, button water sink, means water drips floor keep using wet hands press button, water stays 5 seconds! There also sanitiser doors coach, I seen drivers using sanitiser themselves, good. I missed booked coach, driver let later service without fuss extra payment. could introducing flexible ticket options, amend online need to. I gather ticket option non-refundable ticket can't changed. Although drivers flexible make fuss journey booked initially, big deal. Lastly, bit annoying go way The Town Centre Cheltenham - instead stopping M5 Golden Valley Roundabout. I see it, people travelling beyond Cheltenham sit 30 mins longer drive Town Centre again, keep mind alighting Chektenham, pay get 94 go Stop onto Town Centre. That said, single 94 like 2, still cheaper get pay town, go National Express go way Town Centre. Would use again. Also wish departures frequent ideally 24/7.",2023-02-12

"An excellent service efficient An excellent service efficient superb value money. I travelled Glasgow Aberdeen back M92 express service. The coach tolerably comfortable, journey smooth; 1 way Over-60's Travel Card certainly beats modes transport value. I think full price would 12 way - check sure - that's still low-cost way go. And journey time around 3 hours way, standard train journey time similar (because I took non-stop). Take book read, savour fairly pleasant views en route. I'd given 5 stars toilet board properly cleaned - I expect fault lazy inconsiderate passenger rather . It's certainly driver's job, I would guess small toilet probably pristine start journey.
